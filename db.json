                            "Value": "Since there is no significant difference in onset of effect after intravenous or\r\nintramuscular injection, usually there is no need to use the intravenous route. The drug is quickly effective after either route, with improvement sometimes noticeable a\r\nfew minutes after injection. In emergency situations, when the condition of the\r\npatient is alarming, 1 to 2 mL of the injection normally will provide quick relief. If the\r\nparkinsonian effect begins to return, the dose can be repeated.\r\nBecause of cumulative action, therapy should be initiated with a low dose which is\r\nincreased gradually at five or six-day intervals to the smallest amount necessary for\r\noptimal relief. Increases should be made in increments of 0.5 mg, to a maximum of\r\n6 mg, or until optimal results are obtained without excessive adverse reactions.\r\nPostencephalitic and Idiopathic Parkinsonism: The following dosing guidelines\r\nwere written in reference to both benztropine mesylate tablets and COGENTIN\r\nInjection. Benztropine mesylate tablets should be used when patients are able to\r\ntake oral medication.\r\nThe usual daily dose is 1 to 2 mg, with a range of 0.5 to 6 mg parenterally.\r\nAs with any agent used in parkinsonism, dosage must be individualized according to\r\nage and weight, and the type of parkinsonism being treated. Generally, older\r\npatients, and thin patients cannot tolerate large doses. Most patients with\r\npostencephalitic parkinsonism need fairly large doses and tolerate them well.\r\nPatients with a poor mental outlook are usually poor candidates for therapy.\r\nIn idiopathic parkinsonism, therapy may be initiated with a single daily dose of 0.5 to\r\n1 mg at bedtime. In some patients, this will be adequate; in others 4 to 6 mg a day\r\nmay be required.\r\nIn postencephalitic parkinsonism, therapy may be initiated in most patients with 2 mg\r\na day in one or more doses. In highly sensitive patients, therapy may be initiated\r\nwith 0.5 mg at bedtime, and increased as necessary.\r\nSome patients experience greatest relief when given the entire dose at bedtime;\r\nothers react more favorably to divided doses, two to four times a day. Frequently,\r\none dose a day is sufficient, and divided doses may be unnecessary or undesirable.\r\nThe long duration of action of this drug makes it particularly suitable for bedtime\r\nmedication when its effects may last throughout the night, enabling patients to turn in\r\nbed during the night more easily, and to rise in the morning.\r\nWhen COGENTIN is started, do not terminate therapy with other antiparkinsonian\r\nagents abruptly. If the other agents are to be reduced or discontinued, it must be\r\ndone gradually. Many patients obtain greatest relief with combination therapy.\r\nCOGENTIN may be used concomitantly with SINEMET (CcarbidopaLevodopalevodopa), or with levodopa, in which case dosage adjustment may be\r\nrequired in order to maintain optimum response.\r\nDrug-Induced Extrapyramidal Disorders: In treating extrapyramidal disorders due\r\nto neuroleptic drugs (e.g., phenothiazines), the recommended dosage is 1 to 4 mg\r\nonce or twice a day parenterally. Dosage must be individualized according to the\r\nneed of the patient. Some patients require more than recommended; others do not\r\nneed as much.\r\nIn acute dystonic reactions, 1 to 2 mL of the injection usually relieves the condition\r\nquickly.\r\nWhen extrapyramidal disorders develop soon after initiation of treatment with\r\nneuroleptic drugs (e.g., phenothiazines), they are likely to be transient. One to 2 mg\r\nof COGENTIN two or three times a day usually provides relief within one or two days.\r\nIf such disorders recur, COGENTIN can be reinstituted.\r\nCertain drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders that develop slowly may not respond to COGENTIN."

                            "Value": "Safe use in pregnancy has not been established.\r\nCOGENTIN may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of\r\nhazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.\r\nWhen COGENTIN is given concomitantly with phenothiazines, haloperidol, or other\r\ndrugs with anticholinergic or antidopaminergic activity, patients should be advised to\r\nreport gastrointestinal complaints, fever or heat intolerance promptly. Paralytic ileus,\r\nhyperthermia and heat stroke, all of which have sometimes been fatal, have occurred\r\nin patients taking anticholinergic-type antiparkinsonism drugs, including COGENTIN,\r\nin combination with phenothiazines and/or tricyclic antidepressants.\r\nSince COGENTIN contains structural features of atropine, it may produce anhidrosis.\r\nFor this reason, it should be administered with caution during hot weather, especially\r\nwhen given concomitantly with other atropine-like drugs to the chronically ill, the\r\nalcoholic, those who have central nervous system disease, and those who do\r\nmanual labor in a hot environment. Anhidrosis may occur more readily when some\r\ndisturbance of sweating already exists. If there is evidence of anhidrosis, the\r\npossibility of hyperthermia should be considered. Dosage should be decreased at\r\nthe discretion of the physician so that the ability to maintain body heat equilibrium by perspiration is not impaired. Severe anhidrosis and fatal hyperthermia have\r\noccurred.\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\nGeneral: Since COGENTIN has cumulative action, continued supervision is\r\nadvisable. Patients with a tendency to tachycardia and patients with prostatic\r\nhypertrophy should be observed closely during treatment.\r\nDysuria may occur, but rarely becomes a problem. Urinary retention has been\r\nreported with COGENTIN.\r\nThe drug may cause complaints of weakness and inability to move particular muscle\r\ngroups, especially in large doses. For example, if the neck has been rigid and\r\nsuddenly relaxes, it may feel weak, causing some concern. In this event, dosage\r\nadjustment is required.\r\nMental confusion and excitement may occur with large doses, or in susceptible\r\npatients. Visual hallucinations have been reported occasionally. Furthermore, in the\r\ntreatment of extrapyramidal disorders due to neuroleptic drugs (e.g.,\r\nphenothiazines), in patients with mental disorders, occasionally there may be\r\nintensification of mental symptoms. In such cases, antiparkinsonian drugs can\r\nprecipitate a toxic psychosis. Patients with mental disorders should be kept under\r\ncareful observation, especially at the beginning of treatment or if dosage is\r\nincreased.\r\nTardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy with\r\nphenothiazines and related agents, or may occur after therapy with these drugs have\r\nbeen discontinued. Antiparkinsonism agents do not alleviate the symptoms of\r\ntardive dyskinesia, and in some instances may aggravate them. COGENTIN is not\r\nrecommended for use in patients with tardive dyskinesia.\r\nThe physician should be aware of the possible occurrence of glaucoma. Although\r\nthe drug does not appear to have any adverse effect on simple glaucoma, it probably\r\nshould not be used in angle-closure glaucoma.\r\nDrug Interactions: Antipsychotic drugs such as phenothiazines or haloperidol;\r\ntricyclic antidepressants (see WARNINGS).\r\nPediatric Use: Because of the atropine-like side effects, COGENTIN should be\r\nused with caution in pediatric patients over three years of age (see\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS).\r\nGeriatric Use: Clinical studies of COGENTIN did not include sufficient numbers of\r\nsubjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in\r\nresponses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for\r\nan elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range (see DOSAGE AND\r\nADMINISTRATION) and the dose should be increased only as needed with\r\nmonitoring for the emergence of adverse events (see PRECAUTIONS and\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS)."

Because of the risks of severe\r\nneutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, VERSACLOZ should be used only in patients\r\nwho have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1, 5.4)].\r\nThe effectiveness of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6Â­\r\nweek, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine and\r\nchlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\r\n\r\n1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or\r\nSchizoaffective Disorder\r\nVERSACLOZ is indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with\r\nschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for reexperiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior\r\nrefers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death.\r\nThe effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was\r\ndemonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePTâ„¢ trial [see Clinical Studies\r\n(14.2)]."

The baseline\r\nANC must be at least 1500/ÂµL for the general population, and at least 1000/ÂµL for patients with\r\ndocumented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be\r\nmonitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\r\n\r\n2.2 Dosing Information\r\nThe starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in\r\nincrements of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose\r\ncan be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum\r\ndose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and\r\nsyncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided\r\ndosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\r\n\r\n2.3 Important Administration Instructions\r\nVERSACLOZ Oral Suspension is administered to the mouth by the oral syringes provided (1 mL\r\nor 9 mL). After shaking the bottle for 10 seconds prior to each use, the syringe adaptor is pressed\r\non top of the bottle. The oral syringe (1 mL or 9 mL) is filled with air, and inserted into the\r\nadaptor. The air is dispelled into the bottle and then the bottle is turned upside down. The\r\nprescribed amount of the suspension is drawn from the bottle and dispensed directly to the\r\nmouth. The prescribed dose should be administered immediately after it is prepared. Do not draw\r\na dose and store it in the syringe for later use. After use, the oral syringe may be washed with\r\nwarm water and dried for next use. The bottle may be closed with the same cap without\r\nremoving the bottle adaptor. Educate patients and caregivers on the steps to administer\r\nVERSACLOZ as described in the Patient Instructions for Use.\r\nVERSACLOZ can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].\r\n\r\n2.4 Maintenance Treatment\r\nGenerally, patients responding to VERSACLOZ should continue maintenance treatment on their\r\neffective dose beyond the acute episode.\r\n\r\n2.5 Discontinuation of Treatment\r\nMethod of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patientâ€™s last ANC:\r\nï‚·\t See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt\r\ntreatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia.\r\nï‚·\t Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of VERSACLOZ\r\ntherapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia.\r\nï‚·\t For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of\r\nthe existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their\r\nANC is â‰¥1500/ÂµL and for BEN patients until their ANC is â‰¥1000/ÂµL or above their baseline.\r\nï‚·\t Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature\r\nof 38.5Â°C or 101.3Â°F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1)].\r\nï‚·\t Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms\r\nrelated to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and\r\ndiarrhea.\r\n\r\n2.6 Re-Initiation of Treatment\r\nWhen restarting VERSACLOZ in patients who have discontinued VERSACLOZ (i.e., 2 days or\r\nmore since the last dose), re-initiate with 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions\r\n(5.3)]. If that dose is well tolerated, the dose may be increased to the previously therapeutic dose\r\nmore quickly than recommended for initial treatment.\r\n\r\n2.7 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors\r\nor CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers\r\nDose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2\r\ninhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors\r\n(e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine,\r\nescitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine,\r\nor sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. Johnâ€™s wort, and rifampin);\r\nor CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) (Table 1) [see Drug Interactions (7)].\r\nTable 1: Dose Adjustment in Patients Taking Concomitant Medications\r\nCo-medications Scenarios\r\n Initiating Adding a Discontinuing a\r\nVERSACLOZ co-medication co-medication\r\nwhile taking a while taking while continuing\r\nco-medication VERSACLOZ VERSACLOZ\r\nStrong CYP1A2 Use one third of the VERSACLOZ dose.

The ANC is usually available\r\nas a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant\r\nto drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be\r\ncalculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total\r\npercentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil â€œsegsâ€ plus neutrophil\r\nâ€œbandsâ€). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia\r\nand their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild,\r\nmoderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, â€œsevere\r\nneutropeniaâ€ replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or\r\nagranulocytosis.\r\nSevere neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/ÂµL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking\r\nVERSACLOZ and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal\r\ninfections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then\r\ndeclines. The mechanism by which VERSACLOZ causes neutropenia is unknown and is not\r\ndose-dependent.\r\nTwo separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general\r\npopulation, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia.\r\nVERSACLOZ Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2)\r\nObtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ to\r\nensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL) and\r\nto permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater\r\nthan (â‰¥)1500/ÂµL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate\r\ntreatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of\r\ntreatment. If a patientâ€™s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL for the first 6 months of\r\ntreatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the\r\nANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy,\r\nANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter.\r\nTable 2: VERSACLOZ Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count\r\n(ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population\r\nANC Level VERSACLOZ\r\nTreatment Recommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nNormal range\r\n(â‰¥1500/ÂµL)\r\nï‚· Initiate treatment\r\nï‚· If treatment interrupted:\r\n- <30 days, continue\r\nmonitoring as before\r\n- â‰¥30 days, monitor as if new\r\npatient\r\nï‚· Weekly from initiation to\r\n6 months\r\nï‚· Every 2 weeks from 6 to\r\n12 months\r\nï‚· Monthly after 12 months\r\nï‚· Discontinuation for reasons\r\nother than neutropenia\r\nï‚· See Section 2.4\r\nMild Neutropenia ï‚· Continue treatment ï‚· Three times weekly until\r\n(1000 to 1499/ÂµL)* ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL, return\r\nto patientâ€™s last â€œNormal\r\nRangeâ€ ANC monitoring\r\ninterval**\r\nModerate ï‚· Recommend hematology ï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL,\r\nNeutropenia consultation then\r\n(500 to 999/ÂµL)* ï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapine-induced\r\nneutropenia\r\nï‚· Resume treatment once ANC\r\nâ‰¥1000/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL, check\r\nANC weekly for 4 weeks,\r\nthen return to patientâ€™s last\r\nâ€œNormal Rangeâ€ ANC\r\nmonitoring interval**\r\nSevere Neutropenia ï‚· Recommend hematology ï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL,\r\n(less than 500/ÂµL)* consultation\r\nï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapine-induced\r\nneutropenia\r\nï‚· Do not rechallenge unless\r\nprescriber determines benefits\r\noutweigh risks\r\nthen\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· If patient rechallenged,\r\nresume treatment as a new\r\npatient under â€œNormal\r\nRangeâ€ monitoring once \r\nANC Level VERSACLOZ\r\nTreatment Recommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\n* Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/ÂµL with a repeat ANC measurement within\r\n24 hours\r\n** If clinically appropriate\r\nVERSACLOZ Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table\r\n3)\r\nBenign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average\r\nANC values are lower than â€œstandardâ€ laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly\r\nobserved in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle\r\nEastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more\r\ncommon in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid\r\nmaturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at\r\nincreased risk for developing VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be\r\nneeded to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation\r\nbefore initiating or during VERSACLOZ treatment as necessary.\r\nPatients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for VERSACLOZ management due to\r\ntheir lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing VERSACLOZ\r\ntreatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN.\r\nTable 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); VERSACLOZ Treatment\r\nRecommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring\r\nANC Level Treatment\r\nRecommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nNormal BEN Range\r\n(Established ANC\r\nbaseline â‰¥1000/ÂµL )\r\nï‚· Obtain at least two\r\nbaseline ANC levels\r\nbefore initiating\r\ntreatment\r\nï‚· If treatment interrupted\r\n- <30 days, continue\r\nmonitoring as\r\nbefore\r\n- â‰¥30 days, monitor\r\nas if new patient\r\nï‚· Weekly from initiation to\r\n6 months\r\nï‚· Every 2 weeks from 6 to\r\n12 months\r\nï‚· Monthly after 12 months\r\nï‚· Discontinuation of\r\ntreatment for reasons\r\nother than neutropenia\r\nï‚· See Section 2.4\r\nANC Level Treatment\r\nRecommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nBEN\r\nNeutropenia\r\n(500 to 999/ÂµL)*\r\nï‚· Recommend\r\nhematology\r\nconsultation\r\nï‚· Continue treatment\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until ANC\r\nâ‰¥1000/ÂµL or â‰¥patientâ€™s known\r\nbaseline\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL or at\r\npatientâ€™s known baseline, check\r\nANC weekly for 4 weeks, then\r\nreturn to patientâ€™s last â€œNormal\r\nBEN Rangeâ€ ANC monitoring\r\ninterval.**\r\nBEN\r\nSevere Neutropenia\r\n(less than 500/ÂµL)*\r\nï‚· Recommend\r\nhematology\r\nconsultation\r\nï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapineinduced neutropenia\r\nï‚· Do not rechallenge\r\nunless prescriber\r\ndetermines benefits\r\noutweigh risks\r\nï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥500/ÂµL, then\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until ANC â‰¥\r\npatientâ€™s baseline\r\nï‚· If patient rechallenged, resume\r\ntreatment as a new patient under\r\nâ€œNormal Rangeâ€ monitoring once\r\nANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL or at patientâ€™s\r\nbaseline\r\n* Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/ÂµL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours\r\n** If clinically appropriate\r\nGeneral Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia\r\nï‚·\t Fever: Interrupt VERSACLOZ as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops\r\nfever, defined as a temperature of 38.5Â°C [101.3Â°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level.\r\nFever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection.\r\nï‚·\t ANC less than 1000/ÂµL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/ÂµL,\r\ninitiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for\r\nmanagement.\r\nï‚·\t Consider hematology consultation.\r\nï‚·\t See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Fever under WARNINGS AND\r\nPRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING\r\nINFORMATION (17).\r\nRechallenge after an ANC less than 500/ÂµL (severe neutropenia)\r\nFor some patients who experience severe VERSACLOZ-related neutropenia, the risk of serious\r\npsychiatric illness from discontinuing VERSACLOZ treatment may be greater than the risk of\r\nrechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other\r\nthan VERSACLOZ). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a\r\npatient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with\r\nVERSACLOZ or a clozapine product.\r\nIf a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2\r\nand 3, the patientâ€™s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of VERSACLOZ rechallenge, and the severity and\r\ncharacteristics of the neutropenic episode.\r\nUsing VERSACLOZ with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia\r\nIt is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or\r\nseverity of VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid\r\nVERSACLOZ treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If VERSACLOZ is\r\nused concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic\r\nagents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in\r\nTables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant\r\nchemotherapy.\r\n\r\n5.2 Clozapine REMS Program\r\nVERSACLOZ is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine\r\nREMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia.\r\nNotable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include:\r\nï‚· Healthcare professionals who prescribe VERSACLOZ must be certified with the program by\r\nenrolling and completing training.\r\nï‚· Patients who receive VERSACLOZ must be enrolled in the program and comply with the\r\nANC testing and monitoring requirements.\r\nï‚· Pharmacies dispensing VERSACLOZ must be certified with the program by enrolling and\r\ncompleting training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive\r\nVERSACLOZ.\r\nFurther information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678.\r\n\r\n5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope\r\nHypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment.\r\nThe risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation.\r\nThese reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be\r\nfatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB).\r\nTreatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily\r\ndose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose\r\nof 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks.\r\nSubsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg.\r\nThe maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to\r\nminimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\r\nConsider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a\r\nbrief interval off VERSACLOZ (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at\r\n12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\r\nUse VERSACLOZ cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial\r\ninfarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and\r\nconditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of\r\nantihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia).\r\n\r\n5.4 Seizures\r\nSeizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence\r\nat one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of\r\n1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a\r\ncrude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5\r\nmg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing.\r\nUse caution when administering VERSACLOZ to patients with a history of seizures or other\r\npredisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of\r\nmedications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of\r\nseizure associated with VERSACLOZ use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where\r\nsudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an\r\nautomobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing).\r\n\r\n5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy\r\nMyocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be\r\nfatal. Discontinue VERSACLOZ and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis\r\nor cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or\r\ncardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with VERSACLOZ. However, if the benefit of\r\nVERSACLOZ treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or\r\ncardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with VERSACLOZ in consultation with\r\na cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring.\r\nConsider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving VERSACLOZ\r\nwho present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like\r\nsymptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic\r\nfindings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave\r\nprogression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine\r\ntreatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated\r\nmyocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy\r\ncan occur at any period during treatment with VERSACLOZ. It is common for nonspecific flulike symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede\r\nmore overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T,\r\nelevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).\r\nChest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging\r\n(echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left\r\nventricular dysfunction.\r\n\r\n5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\r\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an\r\nincreased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks),\r\nlargely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated\r\npatients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course\r\nof a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%,\r\ncompared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were\r\nvaried, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death)\r\nor infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical\r\nantipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in\r\nthis population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies\r\nmay be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is\r\nnot clear. VERSACLOZ is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related\r\npsychosis [see Boxed Warning].\r\n\r\n5.7 Eosinophilia\r\nEosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/ÂµL, has occurred with\r\nclozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia.\r\nClozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some\r\npatients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis.\r\nSuch organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic\r\nsymptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS).\r\nIf eosinophilia develops during VERSACLOZ treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and\r\nsymptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other\r\norgan-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is\r\nsuspected, discontinue VERSACLOZ immediately.\r\nIf a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen\r\nvascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and\r\ncontinue VERSACLOZ.\r\nClozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can\r\nresolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of\r\nclozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue\r\nVERSACLOZ under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over\r\nseveral weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt VERSACLOZ therapy\r\nand rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical\r\nassessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist.\r\n\r\n5.8 QT Interval Prolongation\r\nQT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac\r\narrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing\r\nVERSACLOZ, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious\r\ncardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac\r\ndeath, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure,\r\ntreatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ, and electrolyte abnormalities.\r\nPrior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ, perform a careful physical examination, medical\r\nhistory, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum\r\nchemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue VERSACLOZ if the QTc\r\ninterval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes\r\nor other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac\r\nevaluation and discontinue VERSACLOZ.\r\nUse caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific\r\nantipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine,\r\ndroperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin,\r\nsparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III\r\nantiarrhythmic (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate,\r\nmethadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus).\r\nVERSACLOZ is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant\r\ntreatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of VERSACLOZ [see\r\nDrug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\r\nHypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can\r\nresult from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk\r\nfor significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements\r\nof serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct\r\nelectrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ.\r\n\r\n5.9 Metabolic Changes\r\nAtypical antipsychotic drugs, including VERSACLOZ, have been associated with metabolic\r\nchanges that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes\r\ninclude hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs\r\nmay produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile.\r\nHyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus\r\nHyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma\r\nor death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including\r\nVERSACLOZ. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose\r\nabnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes\r\nmellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the\r\ngeneral population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use\r\nand hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However,\r\nepidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related\r\nadverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not\r\navailable.\r\nPatients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on VERSACLOZ\r\nshould be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for\r\ndiabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with\r\natypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of\r\ntreatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics\r\nshould be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia,\r\nand weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical\r\nantipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has\r\nresolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required\r\ncontinuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.\r\nIn a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in\r\nfasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and\r\n+4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical\r\nincreases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group\r\n(Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day).\r\nThe maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day).\r\nThe median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine.\r\nTable 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change\r\n(at least once) from\r\nbaseline\r\nTreatment Arm N n (%)\r\nNormal\r\n(<100 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27)\r\nFasting Glucose\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10)\r\nBorderline\r\n(100 to 125 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥126 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 57 24 (42)\r\nChlorpromazine 43 12 (28)\r\nDyslipidemia\r\nUndesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics,\r\nincluding VERSACLOZ. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid\r\nevaluations in patients using VERSACLOZ, is recommended.\r\nIn a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment\r\nwas associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and\r\nHDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group\r\nand 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult\r\nsubjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum\r\ntriglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine\r\ntreatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as\r\nillustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or\r\nfasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine\r\nand chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range\r\nwas 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.\r\nTable 5: Mean Changes in Total Cholesterol and Triglyceride Concentration in Studies in\r\nAdult Subjects with Schizophrenia\r\nTreatment Arm Baseline total cholesterol\r\nconcentration (mg/dL)\r\nChange from baseline\r\nmg/dL (%)\r\nClozapine (N=334) 184 +13 (7)\r\nChlorpromazine (N=185) 182 +15 (8)\r\nBaseline triglyceride\r\nconcentration (mg/dL)\r\nChange from baseline\r\nmg/dL (%)\r\nClozapine (N=6) 130 +71 (54)\r\nChlorpromazine (N=7) 110 +39 (35)\r\nTable 6: Categorical Changes in Lipid Concentrations in Studies in Adult Subjects with\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change (at\r\nleast once) from\r\nBaseline\r\nTreatment\r\nArm N n (%)\r\nTotal\r\nCholesterol\r\n(random or\r\nfasting)\r\nIncrease by â‰¥40 mg/dL\r\nClozapine 334 111 (33)\r\nChlorpromazine 185 46 (25)\r\nNormal (<200 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥240 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 222 18 (8)\r\nChlorpromazine 132 3 (2)\r\nBorderline\r\n(200 - 239 mg/dL) to\r\nHigh (â‰¥240 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 79 30 (38)\r\nChlorpromazine 34 14 (41)\r\nTriglycerides\r\n(fasting)\r\nIncrease by â‰¥50 mg/dL\r\nClozapine 6 3 (50)\r\nChlorpromazine 7 3 (43)\r\nNormal (<150 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥200 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 4 0 (0)\r\nChlorpromazine 6 2 (33)\r\nBorderline\r\n(â‰¥150 mg/dL and Clozapine 1 1 (100)\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change (at\r\nleast once) from\r\nBaseline\r\nTreatment\r\nArm N n (%)\r\n<200 mg/dL) to\r\nHigh (â‰¥200 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 1 0 (0)\r\nWeight Gain\r\nWeight gain has occurred with the use of antipsychotics, including VERSACLOZ. Monitor\r\nweight during treatment with VERSACLOZ. Table 7 summarizes the data on weight gain by the\r\nduration of exposure pooled from 11 studies with clozapine and active comparators. The median\r\nduration of exposure was 609, 728, and 42 days, in the clozapine, olanzapine, and\r\nchlorpromazine group, respectively.\r\nTable 7: Mean Change in Body Weight (kg) by duration of exposure from studies in adult\r\nsubjects with schizophrenia\r\nMetabolic\r\nparameter Exposure duration\r\nClozapine\r\n(N=669)\r\nOlanzapine\r\n(N=442)\r\nChlorpromazine\r\n(N=155)\r\nn Mean n Mean n Mean\r\nWeight\r\nchange from\r\nbaseline\r\n2 weeks (Day 11 â€“ 17) 6 +0.9 3 +0.7 2 -0.5\r\n4 weeks (Day 21 â€“ 35) 23 +0.7 8 +0.8 17 +0.6\r\n8 weeks (Day 49 â€“ 63) 12 +1.9 13 +1.8 16 +0.9\r\n12 weeks (Day 70 â€“ 98) 17 +2.8 5 +3.1 0 0\r\n24 weeks\r\n(Day 154 â€“ 182) 42 -0.6 12 +5.7 0 0\r\n48 weeks\r\n(Day 322 â€“ 350) 3 +3.7 3 +13.7 0 0\r\nTable 8 summarizes pooled data from 11 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia\r\ndemonstrating weight gain â‰¥7% of body weight relative to baseline.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include\r\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or\r\nblood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can\r\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal\r\nfailure.\r\nThe diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to\r\nconsider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection,\r\nheat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms,\r\nand drug fever).\r\nThe management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs\r\nand other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and\r\nmedical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general\r\nagreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS.\r\nIf a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential\r\nreintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if\r\nrestarting treatment with antipsychotics.\r\nNMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications,\r\nincluding lithium.\r\n\r\n5.11 Fever\r\nDuring clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak\r\nincidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and selflimited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase\r\nor decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia\r\nor infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].\r\n\r\n5.12 Pulmonary Embolism\r\nPulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine.\r\nConsider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep vein\r\nthrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether\r\npulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some\r\ncharacteristic(s) of patients is not clear.\r\n\r\n5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity\r\nVERSACLOZ has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with VERSACLOZ can result in\r\nCNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle\r\nglaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in\r\nwhich anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions.\r\nTreatment with VERSACLOZ can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including\r\nconstipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be\r\nfatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary\r\ntherapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more\r\nserious cases.\r\n\r\n5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance\r\nVERSACLOZ can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution\r\npatients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably\r\ncertain that VERSACLOZ does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related.\r\nConsider reducing the dose if they occur.\r\n\r\n5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia\r\nTardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including\r\nVERSACLOZ. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic\r\nmovements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to\r\nincrease with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the\r\nsyndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe\r\nVERSACLOZ in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the\r\nlowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically\r\nassess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs.\r\nHowever, some patients may require treatment with VERSACLOZ despite the presence of the\r\nsyndrome.\r\nThere is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely\r\nif treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress)\r\nthe signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of\r\nsymptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown.\r\n\r\n5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions\r\nIn controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical\r\nantipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions\r\n(e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased\r\nrisk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for VERSACLOZ or other\r\nantipsychotics or other patient populations. VERSACLOZ should be used with caution in\r\npatients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.\r\n\r\n5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of\r\nVERSACLOZ\r\nIf abrupt discontinuation of VERSACLOZ is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or\r\nanother medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse\r\nreactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting,\r\nand diarrhea.

While these symptoms can occur\r\nat low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at\r\nhigher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is\r\nobserved in males and younger age groups.\r\n\r\n6.2 Postmarketing Experience\r\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clozapine.\r\nBecause these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not\r\nalways possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug\r\nexposure.\r\nCentral Nervous System\r\nDelirium, EEG abnormal, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus,\r\nobsessive compulsive symptoms, and post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse\r\nreactions.\r\nCardiovascular System\r\nAtrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de\r\nPointes, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and periorbital edema.\r\nEndocrine System\r\nPseudopheochromocytoma.\r\nGastrointestinal System\r\nAcute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling.\r\nHepatobiliary System\r\nCholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic\r\nfibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), and liver failure.\r\nImmune System Disorders\r\nAngioedema, leukocytoclastic vasculitis.\r\nUrogenital System\r\nAcute interstitial nephritis, nocturnal enuresis, priapism, and renal failure.\r\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders\r\nHypersensitivity reactions: photosensitivity, vasculitis, erythema multiforme, skin pigmentation\r\ndisorder, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.\r\nMusculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Disorders\r\nMyasthenic syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.\r\nRespiratory System\r\nAspiration, pleural effusion, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection.\r\nHemic and Lymphatic System\r\nMild, moderate, or severe leukopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, WBC decreased, deep\r\nvein thrombosis, elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\r\nincreased, sepsis, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia.\r\nVision Disorders\r\nNarrow-angle glaucoma.\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nCreatine phosphokinase elevation, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, and weight loss.

Use caution when administering VERSACLOZ concomitantly with drugs that are\r\ninducers or inhibitors of these enzymes.\r\nCYP1A2 Inhibitors\r\nConcomitant use of VERSACLOZ and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of\r\nclozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the VERSACLOZ dose to one third\r\nof the original dose when VERSACLOZ is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g.,\r\nfluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The VERSACLOZ dose should be increased to the\r\noriginal dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage\r\nand Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\r\nModerate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients\r\nclosely when VERSACLOZ is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the\r\nVERSACLOZ dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nCYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors\r\nConcomitant treatment with VERSACLOZ and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g.,\r\ncimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine,\r\nterbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical\r\nPharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors.\r\nConsider reducing the VERSACLOZ dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nCYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers\r\nConcomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma\r\nconcentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of VERSACLOZ. Tobacco\r\nsmoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine,\r\nphenytoin, St. Johnâ€™s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the VERSACLOZ dose\r\nif used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of\r\nVERSACLOZ and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and\r\nAdministration (2.7)].\r\nConsider reducing the VERSACLOZ dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme\r\ninducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and\r\nan increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nDrugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation\r\nUse caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific\r\nantipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin,\r\nsparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III\r\nantiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate,\r\nmethadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see\r\nWarnings and Precautions (5.8)].\r\n\r\n7.2 Potential for VERSACLOZ to Affect Other Drugs\r\nConcomitant use of VERSACLOZ with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels\r\nof these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering VERSACLOZ with other drugs\r\nthat are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than\r\nusually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine,\r\nand Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide). "

                            "Value": "8.1 Pregnancy\r\nPregnancy Category B\r\nRisk Summary\r\nThere are no adequate or well-controlled studies of clozapine in pregnant women.\r\nReproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times,\r\nrespectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 900 mg/day on a mg/m2\r\n body\r\nsurface area basis. The studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due\r\nto clozapine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response,\r\nVERSACLOZ should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\r\nClinical Considerations\r\nConsider the risk of exacerbation of psychosis when discontinuing or changing treatment with\r\nantipsychotic medications during pregnancy and postpartum. Consider early screening for\r\ngestational diabetes for patients treated with antipsychotic medications [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.9)]. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of\r\npregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery.\r\nMonitor neonates for symptoms of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence,\r\nrespiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The severity of complications can vary from selflimited symptoms to some neonates requiring intensive care unit support and prolonged\r\nhospitalization.\r\nAnimal Data\r\nIn embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter\r\nsizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period\r\nof organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a\r\nmg/m2 body surface area basis. \r\nIn peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over\r\nthe last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at\r\nbirth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and\r\nmated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or\r\nbody weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day\r\non a mg/m2 body surface area basis.\r\n\r\n8.3 Nursing Mothers\r\nVERSACLOZ is present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in\r\nnursing infants from VERSACLOZ, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing\r\nor to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\n\r\n8.4 Pediatric Use\r\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n\r\n8.5 Geriatric Use\r\nThere have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing\r\nVERSACLOZ to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in\r\ntheir response to VERSACLOZ.\r\nOrthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning\r\nand Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised\r\ncardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects.\r\nElderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such\r\nas urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].\r\nCarefully select VERSACLOZ doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater\r\nfrequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease\r\nand other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia\r\nappears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.15)].\r\n\r\n8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment\r\nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic\r\nfunction. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is\r\nalmost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Clinical\r\nPharmacology (12.3)].\r\n\r\n8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers\r\nDose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine\r\nconcentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Clinical Pharmacology\r\n(12.3)].\r\n\r\n8.8 Hospice Patients\r\nFor hospice patients (i.e., terminally ill patients with an estimated life expectancy of 6 months or\r\nless), the prescriber may reduce the ANC monitoring frequency to once every 6 months, after a\r\ndiscussion with the patient and his/her caregiver. Individual treatment decisions should weigh the\r\nimportance of monitoring ANC in the context of the need to control psychiatric symptoms and\r\nthe patientâ€™s terminal illness. "

A manic episode is a distinct\r\nperiod of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Typical symptoms of\r\nmania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas,\r\ngrandiosity, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possible hostility. A mixed episode is characterized\r\nby the criteria for a manic episode in conjunction with those for a major depressive episode\r\n(depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities).\r\nThe efficacy of Depakote ER is based in part on studies of Depakote (divalproex sodium delayed\r\nrelease tablets) in this indication, and was confirmed in a 3-week trial with patients meeting DSM-IV\r\nTR criteria for bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed type, who were hospitalized for acute mania [see\r\nClinical Studies (14.1)].\r\nThe effectiveness of valproate for long-term use in mania, i.e., more than 3 weeks, has not been\r\ndemonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, healthcare providers who elect to use Depakote\r\nER for extended periods should continually reevaluate the long-term risk-benefits of the drug for the\r\nindividual patient.\r\n1.2 Epilepsy\r\nDepakote ER is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult patients\r\nand pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years with complex partial seizures that occur either in\r\nisolation or in association with other types of seizures. Depakote ER is also indicated for use as sole\r\nand adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures in adults and\r\nchildren 10 years of age or older, and adjunctively in adults and children 10 years of age or older with\r\nmultiple seizure types that include absence seizures.\r\nSimple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness\r\naccompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs.\r\nComplex absence is the term used when other signs are also present.\r\n1.3 Migraine\r\nDepakote ER is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches. There is no evidence that Depakote\r\nER is useful in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. Because it may be a hazard to the fetus,\r\nDepakote ER should be considered for women of childbearing potential only after this risk has been\r\nthoroughly discussed with the patient and weighed against the potential benefits of treatment [see\r\nWarnings and Precautions (5.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]."

Depakote\r\nER tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be crushed or chewed.\r\n2.1 Mania\r\nDepakote ER tablets are administered orally. The recommended initial dose is 25 mg/kg/day given\r\nonce daily. The dose should be increased as rapidly as possible to achieve the lowest therapeutic\r\ndose which produces the desired clinical effect or the desired range of plasma concentrations. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of acute mania or mixed type, patients were dosed to a clinical\r\nresponse with a trough plasma concentration between 85 and 125 mcg/mL. The maximum\r\nrecommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day.\r\nThere is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer term\r\nmanagement of a patient who improves during Depakote ER treatment of an acute manic episode.\r\nWhile it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is\r\ndesirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes,\r\nthere are no data to support the benefits of Depakote ER in such longer-term treatment (i.e., beyond\r\n3 weeks).\r\n2.2 Epilepsy\r\nDepakote ER (divalproex sodium) extended release tablets are administered orally, and must be\r\nswallowed whole. As Depakote ER dosage is titrated upward, concentrations of clonazepam,\r\ndiazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, tolbutamide, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and/or phenytoin\r\nmay be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\r\nComplex Partial Seizures\r\nFor adults and children 10 years of age or older.\r\nMonotherapy (Initial Therapy)\r\nDepakote ER has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at\r\n10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal\r\nclinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day.\r\nIf satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to\r\ndetermine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No\r\nrecommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be\r\nmade.\r\nThe probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma\r\nconcentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved\r\nseizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of\r\nadverse reactions.\r\nConversion to Monotherapy\r\nPatients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10\r\nmg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at\r\ndaily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma\r\nlevels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic\r\nrange (50 - 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses\r\nabove 60 mg/kg/day can be made.\r\nConcomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every\r\n2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Depakote ER therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2\r\nweeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration\r\nof withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored\r\nclosely during this period for increased seizure frequency.\r\nAdjunctive Therapy\r\nDepakote ER may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage\r\nmay be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal\r\nclinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has\r\nnot been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the\r\nusually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of\r\nvalproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.\r\nIn a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either\r\ncarbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin\r\ndosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or\r\nother concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration\r\ndeterminations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug\r\nInteractions (7)].\r\nSimple and Complex Absence Seizures\r\nThe recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10\r\nmg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum\r\nrecommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day.\r\nA good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and\r\ntherapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with\r\nabsence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled\r\nwith lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\r\nAs Depakote ER dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin\r\nmay be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\r\nAntiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered\r\nto prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with\r\nattendant hypoxia and threat to life.\r\n2.3 Migraine\r\nDepakote ER is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults.\r\nThe recommended starting dose is 500 mg once daily for 1 week, thereafter increasing to 1000 mg\r\nonce daily. Although doses other than 1000 mg once daily of Depakote ER have not been evaluated\r\nin patients with migraine, the effective dose range of Depakote (divalproex sodium delayed-release\r\ntablets) in these patients is 500-1000 mg/day. As with other valproate products, doses of Depakote\r\nER should be individualized and dose adjustment may be necessary. If a patient requires smaller\r\ndose adjustments than that available with Depakote ER, Depakote should be used instead.\r\n2.4 Conversion from Depakote to Depakote ER\r\nIn adult patients and pediatric patients 10 years of age or older with epilepsy previously receiving\r\nDepakote, Depakote ER should be administered once-daily using a dose 8 to 20% higher than the\r\ntotal daily dose of Depakote (Table 1). For patients whose Depakote total daily dose cannot be\r\ndirectly converted to Depakote ER, consideration may be given at the clinicianâ€™s discretion to increase\r\nthe patientâ€™s Depakote total daily dose to the next higher dosage before converting to the appropriate\r\ntotal daily dose of Depakote ER.\r\nTable 1. Dose Conversion\r\nDepakote Depakote ER\r\nTotal Daily Dose (mg) (mg)\r\n500* - 625 750\r\n750* - 875 1000\r\n1000*-1125 1250\r\n1250-1375 1500\r\n1500-1625 1750\r\n1750 2000\r\n1875-2000 2250\r\n2125-2250 2500\r\n2375 2750\r\n2500-2750 3000\r\n2875 3250\r\n3000-3125 3500\r\n* These total daily doses of Depakote cannot be directly converted to an 8 to 20% higher total daily dose of\r\nDepakote ER because the required dosing strengths of Depakote ER are not available. Consideration may be\r\ngiven at the clinician's discretion to increase the patient's Depakote total daily dose to the next higher dosage\r\nbefore converting to the appropriate total daily dose of Depakote ER.\r\nThere is insufficient data to allow a conversion factor recommendation for patients with DEPAKOTE\r\ndoses above 3125 mg/day. Plasma valproate Cmin concentrations for DEPAKOTE ER on average are\r\nequivalent to DEPAKOTE, but may vary across patients after conversion. If satisfactory clinical\r\nresponse has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not\r\nthey are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL) [see Clinical Pharmacology\r\n(12.2)].\r\n2.5 General Dosing Advice\r\nDosing in Elderly Patients\r\nDue to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to\r\nsomnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Starting doses in\r\nthe elderly lower than 250mg can only be achieved by the use of Depakote. Dosage should be\r\nincreased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration,\r\nsomnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be\r\nconsidered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence.\r\nThe ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical\r\nresponse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].\r\nDose-Related Adverse Reactions\r\nThe frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be\r\ndose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate\r\nconcentrations of â‰¥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or â‰¥ 135 mcg/mL (males) [see Warnings and Precautions\r\n(5.7)]. The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the\r\npossibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.\r\nG.I. Irritation\r\nPatients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by\r\nslowly building up the dose from an initial low level.\r\nCompliance\r\nPatients should be informed to take Depakote ER every day as prescribed. If a dose is missed it\r\nshould be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. If a dose is skipped,\r\nthe patient should not double the next dose."

                            "Value": "5.1 Hepatotoxicity\r\nHepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents\r\nusually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be\r\npreceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia,\r\nand vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be\r\nmonitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Liver function tests should be performed prior\r\nto therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months. However,\r\nhealthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be\r\nabnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and\r\nphysical examination.\r\nCaution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of\r\nhepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic\r\ndisorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with\r\norganic brain disease may be at particular risk. Experience has indicated that children under the age\r\nof two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those\r\nwith the aforementioned conditions. When Depakote ER is used in this patient group, it should be\r\nused with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against\r\nthe risks. Above this age group, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal\r\nhepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.\r\nThe drug should be discontinued immediately in the presence of significant hepatic dysfunction,\r\nsuspected or apparent. In some cases, hepatic dysfunction has progressed in spite of discontinuation\r\nof drug [see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (4)].\r\n5.2 Use in Women of Childbearing Potential\r\nBecause of the risk to the fetus of neural tube defects and other major congenital malformations,\r\nwhich may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of\r\nchildbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition. This is\r\nespecially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with\r\npermanent injury or death (e.g., migraine). Women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Women who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled regarding the relative risks\r\nand benefits of valproate use during pregnancy, and alternative therapeutic options should be\r\nconsidered for these patients. [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\r\nTo prevent major seizures, Depakote ER should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate\r\nstatus epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.\r\nEvidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of\r\npregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population.\r\n5.3 Birth Defects and Neurobehavioral Adverse Effects\r\nValproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data\r\nshow that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities\r\n(e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and malformations involving various body\r\nsystems). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is\r\nabout four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure\r\nmonotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the\r\nfirst trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general\r\npopulation.\r\nSeveral published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero\r\nhave lower cognitive test scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or\r\nto no antiepileptic drugs in utero. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study\r\nconducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to\r\nvalproate had lower Differential Ability Scale (D.A.S.) scores at age 3 (92 [95% C.I. 88-97]) than\r\nchildren with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated:\r\nlamotrigine (101 [95% C.I. 98-104]), carbamazepine (98 [95% C.I. 95-102]) and phenytoin (99 [95%\r\nC.I. 94 -104]). The D.A.S., which has a mean score of 100 (SD = 15), is a battery of cognitive tests\r\ndesigned for children ages 2.5 to 17 years. The D.A.S. is a measure of neurobehavioral development\r\nperformed when children are too young to undergo IQ testing and generally correlates with IQ scores\r\nlater in childhood.\r\nAlthough all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence\r\nsupports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero causes subsequent adverse effects on\r\ncognitive development.\r\nIn animal studies, valproate-exposed offspring had malformations similar to those seen in humans\r\nand demonstrated behavioral deficits. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]\r\n5.4 Pancreatitis\r\nCases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving\r\nvalproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with rapid progression from initial\r\nsymptoms to death. Some cases have occurred shortly after initial use as well as after several years\r\nof use. The rate based upon the reported cases exceeds that expected in the general population and\r\nthere have been cases in which pancreatitis recurred after rechallenge with valproate. In clinical trials,\r\nthere were 2 cases of pancreatitis without alternative etiology in 2416 patients, representing 1044\r\npatient-years experience. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea,\r\nvomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If\r\npancreatitis is diagnosed, Depakote ER should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for\r\nthe underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated [see Boxed Warning].\r\n5.5 Urea Cycle Disorders\r\nDepakote ER is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD).\r\nHyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of\r\nvalproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities,\r\nparticularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Prior to the initiation of Depakote ER therapy,\r\nevaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1) those with a history of\r\nunexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancyrelated or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma\r\nammonia or glutamine; 2) those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability,\r\nataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3) those with a family history of UCD or a family history of\r\nunexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD.\r\nPatients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving\r\nvalproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.9)].\r\n5.6 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation\r\nAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Depakote ER, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior\r\nin patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication\r\nshould be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior,\r\nand/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.\r\nPooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11\r\ndifferent AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk\r\n(adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients\r\nrandomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the\r\nestimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was\r\n0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of\r\napproximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were\r\nfour suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the\r\nnumber is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\r\nThe increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week\r\nafter starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed.\r\nBecause most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal\r\nthoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.\r\nThe risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed.\r\nThe finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of\r\nindications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary\r\nsubstantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.\r\nTable 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.\r\nTable 2. Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis\r\nIndication Placebo Patients\r\nwith Events Per\r\n1000 Patients\r\nDrug Patients with\r\nEvents Per 1000\r\nPatients\r\nRelative Risk:\r\nIncidence of\r\nEvents in Drug\r\nPatients/Incidence\r\nRisk Difference:\r\nAdditional Drug\r\nPatients with\r\nEvents Per 1000\r\nin Placebo\r\nPatients\r\nPatients\r\nEpilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4\r\nPsychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9\r\nOther 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9\r\nTotal 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9\r\nThe relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in\r\nclinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the\r\nepilepsy and psychiatric indications.\r\nAnyone considering prescribing Depakote ER or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal\r\nthoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which\r\nAEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of\r\nsuicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the\r\nprescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be\r\nrelated to the illness being treated.\r\nPatients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal\r\nthoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening\r\nof the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the\r\nemergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should\r\nbe reported immediately to healthcare providers.\r\n5.7 Thrombocytopenia\r\nThe frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be\r\ndose-related. In a clinical trial of valproate as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients\r\n(27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets â‰¤ 75 x\r\n109/L. Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts\r\nto normal. In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment. In this\r\nstudy, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate\r\nconcentrations of â‰¥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or â‰¥ 135 mcg/mL (males). The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater\r\nincidence of adverse effects.\r\nBecause of reports of thrombocytopenia, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation,\r\nand abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen), platelet counts and coagulation tests are\r\nrecommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients\r\nreceiving Depakote ER be monitored for platelet count and coagulation parameters prior to planned\r\nsurgery. Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication\r\nfor reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.\r\n5.8 Hyperammonemia\r\nHyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present\r\ndespite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or\r\nchanges in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia\r\nlevel should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with\r\nhypothermia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy\r\nshould be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be\r\ninitiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders [see\r\nContraindications and Warnings and Precautions (4, 5.5, 5.8, 5.9)].\r\nDuring the placebo controlled pediatric mania trial, one (1) in twenty (20) adolescents (5%) treated\r\nwith valproate developed increased plasma ammonia levels compared to no (0) patients treated with\r\nplacebo.\r\nAsymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring\r\nof plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be\r\nconsidered.\r\n5.9 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use\r\nConcomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia\r\nwith or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. Clinical symptoms of\r\nhyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or\r\ncognitive function with lethargy or vomiting. Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. In most cases, symptoms and signs\r\nabated with discontinuation of either drug. This adverse event is not due to a pharmacokinetic\r\ninteraction. It is not known if topiramate monotherapy is associated with hyperammonemia. Patients\r\nwith inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk\r\nfor hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, an interaction of\r\ntopiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible\r\npersons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status,\r\nhyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured\r\n[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].\r\n5.10 Hypothermia\r\nHypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to < 35Â° C (95Â° F), has been\r\nreported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of\r\nhyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate\r\nwith valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate [see\r\nDrug Interactions (7.3)]. Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop\r\nhypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy,\r\nconfusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular\r\nand respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood\r\nammonia levels.\r\n5.11 Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity Reactions\r\nMulti-organ hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported in close temporal association to the\r\ninitiation of valproate therapy in adult and pediatric patients (median time to detection 21 days: range\r\n1 to 40 days). Although there have been a limited number of reports, many of these cases resulted in\r\nhospitalization and at least one death has been reported. Signs and symptoms of this disorder were\r\ndiverse; however, patients typically, although not exclusively, presented with fever and rash\r\nassociated with other organ system involvement. Other associated manifestations may include\r\nlymphadenopathy, hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, hematological abnormalities (e.g.,\r\neosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), pruritus, nephritis, oliguria, hepato-renal syndrome,\r\narthralgia, and asthenia. Because the disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system\r\nsymptoms and signs, not noted here, may occur. If this reaction is suspected, valproate should be discontinued and an alternative treatment started. Although the existence of cross sensitivity with\r\nother drugs that produce this syndrome is unclear, the experience amongst drugs associated with\r\nmulti-organ hypersensitivity would indicate this to be a possibility.\r\n5.12 Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics\r\nCarbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list)\r\nmay reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure\r\ncontrol. Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem\r\ntherapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate\r\nconcentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\r\n5.13 Somnolence in the Elderly\r\nIn a double-blind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age = 83\r\nyears), doses were increased by 125 mg/day to a target dose of 20 mg/kg/day. A significantly higher\r\nproportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically\r\nsignificant, there was a higher proportion of patients with dehydration. Discontinuations for\r\nsomnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo. In some patients with somnolence\r\n(approximately one-half), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss. There was\r\na trend for the patients who experienced these events to have a lower baseline albumin\r\nconcentration, lower valproate clearance, and a higher BUN. In elderly patients, dosage should be\r\nincreased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration,\r\nsomnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be\r\nconsidered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence\r\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\r\n5.14 Monitoring: Drug Plasma Concentration\r\nSince valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme\r\ninduction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are\r\nrecommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].\r\n5.15 Effect on Ketone and Thyroid Function Tests\r\nValproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a keto-metabolite which may lead to a false\r\ninterpretation of the urine ketone test.\r\nThere have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate. The clinical\r\nsignificance of these is unknown.\r\n5.16 Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication\r\nThere are in vitro studies that suggest valproate stimulates the replication of the HIV and CMV\r\nviruses under certain experimental conditions. The clinical consequence, if any, is not known.\r\nAdditionally, the relevance of these in vitro findings is uncertain for patients receiving maximally\r\nsuppressive antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, these data should be borne in mind when\r\ninterpreting the results from regular monitoring of the viral load in HIV infected patients receiving\r\nvalproate or when following CMV infected patients clinically."

These effects are usually transient and rarely require discontinuation of therapy.\r\nDiarrhea, abdominal cramps, and constipation have been reported. Both anorexia with some weight\r\nloss and increased appetite with weight gain have also been reported. In some patients, many of\r\nwhom have functional or anatomic (including ileostomy or colostomy) gastrointestinal disorders with\r\nshortened GI transit times, there have been postmarketing reports of Depakote ER tablets in stool.\r\nCNS Effects\r\nSedative effects have occurred in patients receiving valproate alone but occur most often in patients\r\nreceiving combination therapy. Sedation usually abates upon reduction of other antiepileptic\r\nmedication. Tremor (may be dose-related), hallucinations, ataxia, headache, nystagmus, diplopia,\r\nasterixis, \"spots before eyes\", dysarthria, dizziness, confusion, hypesthesia, vertigo, incoordination,\r\nand parkinsonism have been reported with the use of valproate. Rare cases of coma have occurred\r\nin patients receiving valproate alone or in conjunction with phenobarbital. In rare instances\r\nencephalopathy with or without fever has developed shortly after the introduction of valproate\r\nmonotherapy without evidence of hepatic dysfunction or inappropriately high plasma valproate levels.\r\nAlthough recovery has been described following drug withdrawal, there have been fatalities in\r\npatients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy, particularly in patients with underlying urea cycle\r\ndisorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].\r\nSeveral reports have noted reversible cerebral atrophy and dementia in association with valproate\r\ntherapy.\r\nDermatologic\r\nTransient hair loss, skin rash, photosensitivity, generalized pruritus, erythema multiforme, and\r\nStevens-Johnson syndrome. Rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported including a\r\nfatal case in a 6 month old infant taking valproate and several other concomitant medications. An\r\nadditional case of toxic epidermal necrosis resulting in death was reported in a 35 year old patient with AIDS taking several concomitant medications and with a history of multiple cutaneous drug\r\nreactions.

                            "Value": "7.1 Effects of Co-Administered Drugs on Valproate Clearance\r\nDrugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of\r\nglucuronosyltransferases, may increase the clearance of valproate. For example, phenytoin,\r\ncarbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate. Thus,\r\npatients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients\r\nreceiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.\r\nIn contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be\r\nexpected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated\r\noxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and betaoxidation.\r\nBecause of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug\r\nconcentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn.\r\nThe following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly\r\nprescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics. The list is not exhaustive nor could it be,\r\nsince new interactions are continuously being reported.\r\nDrugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed\r\nAspirin\r\nA study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate\r\nto pediatric patients (n=6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of\r\nvalproate. Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to\r\nvalproate alone. The Î²-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-\r\nketo valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3%\r\nin the presence of aspirin. Whether or not the interaction observed in this study applies to adults is\r\nunknown, but caution should be observed if valproate and aspirin are to be co-administered.\r\nCarbapenem antibiotics\r\nA clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients\r\nreceiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a\r\ncomplete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction in not well\r\nunderstood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating\r\ncarbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if\r\nserum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Warnings\r\nand Precautions (5.12)].\r\nFelbamate\r\nA study involving the co-administration of 1200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with\r\nepilepsy (n=10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115\r\nmcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2400 mg/day increased the\r\nmean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate\r\ndosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.\r\nRifampin\r\nA study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of\r\ndaily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.\r\nValproate dosage adjustment may be necessary when it is co-administered with rifampin.\r\nDrugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed\r\nAntacids\r\nA study involving the co-administration of valproate 500 mg with commonly administered antacids\r\n(Maalox, Trisogel, and Titralac - 160 mEq doses) did not reveal any effect on the extent of absorption\r\nof valproate.\r\nChlorpromazine\r\nA study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients\r\nalready receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15% increase in trough plasma levels of\r\nvalproate.\r\nHaloperidol\r\nA study involving the administration of 6 to 10 mg/day of haloperidol to schizophrenic patients already\r\nreceiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed no significant changes in valproate trough plasma levels.\r\nCimetidine and Ranitidine\r\nCimetidine and ranitidine do not affect the clearance of valproate.\r\n7.2 Effects of Valproate on Other Drugs\r\nValproate has been found to be a weak inhibitor of some P450 isozymes, epoxide hydrase, and\r\nglucuronosyltransferases. \r\nThe following list provides information about the potential for an influence of valproate coadministration on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of several commonly prescribed\r\nmedications. The list is not exhaustive, since new interactions are continuously being reported.\r\nDrugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed\r\nAmitriptyline/Nortriptyline\r\nAdministration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5\r\nfemales) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of\r\namitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline. Rare postmarketing reports of\r\nconcurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been\r\nreceived. Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity.\r\nMonitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly\r\nwith amitriptyline. Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in\r\nthe presence of valproate.\r\nCarbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide\r\nSerum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide\r\n(CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.\r\nClonazepam\r\nThe concomitant use of valproate and clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a\r\nhistory of absence type seizures.\r\nDiazepam\r\nValproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism. Coadministration of valproate (1500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in\r\nhealthy volunteers (n=6). Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were\r\nreduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate. The elimination half-life of\r\ndiazepam remained unchanged upon addition of valproate.\r\nEthosuximide\r\nValproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide. Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of\r\n500 mg with valproate (800 to 1600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n=6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as\r\ncompared to ethosuximide alone. Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along\r\nwith other anticonvulsants, should be monitored for alterations in serum concentrations of both drugs.\r\nLamotrigine\r\nIn a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine\r\nincreased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase). The dose of\r\nlamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate. Serious skin reactions (such as\r\nStevens - Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported with concomitant\r\nlamotrigine and valproate administration. See lamotrigine package insert for details on lamotrigine\r\ndosing with concomitant valproate administration.\r\nPhenobarbital\r\nValproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital. Co-administration of valproate (250\r\nmg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n=6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life\r\nand a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose). The fraction of\r\nphenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.\r\nThere is evidence for severe CNS depression, with or without significant elevations of barbiturate or\r\nvalproate serum concentrations. All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be\r\nclosely monitored for neurological toxicity. Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if\r\npossible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.\r\nPrimidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction with\r\nvalproate.\r\nPhenytoin\r\nValproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic\r\nmetabolism. Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal\r\nvolunteers (n=7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin. Total plasma\r\nclearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of\r\nvalproate. Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.\r\nIn patients with epilepsy, there have been reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with the\r\ncombination of valproate and phenytoin. The dosage of phenytoin should be adjusted as required by\r\nthe clinical situation.\r\nTolbutamide\r\nFrom in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when\r\nadded to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate. The clinical relevance of this\r\ndisplacement is unknown.\r\nWarfarin\r\nIn an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%. The\r\ntherapeutic relevance of this is unknown; however, coagulation tests should be monitored if valproate\r\ntherapy is instituted in patients taking anticoagulants.\r\nZidovudine\r\nIn six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was\r\ndecreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine\r\nwas unaffected.\r\nDrugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed\r\nAcetaminophen\r\nValproate had no effect on any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of acetaminophen when it was\r\nconcurrently administered to three epileptic patients.\r\nClozapine\r\nIn psychotic patients (n=11), no interaction was observed when valproate was co-administered with\r\nclozapine.\r\nLithium\r\nCo-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lithium carbonate (300 mg TID) to normal male\r\nvolunteers (n=16) had no effect on the steady-state kinetics of lithium.\r\nLorazepam\r\nConcomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male\r\nvolunteers (n=9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.\r\nOral Contraceptive Steroids\r\nAdministration of a single-dose of ethinyloestradiol (50 mcg)/levonorgestrel (250 mcg) to 6 women on\r\nvalproate (200 mg BID) therapy for 2 months did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interaction.\r\n7.3 Topiramate\r\nConcomitant administration of valproate and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia\r\nwith and without encephalopathy [see Contraindications and Warnings and Precautions (4, 5.8, 5.9)].\r\nConcomitant administration of topiramate with valproate has also been associated with hypothermia\r\nin patients who have tolerated either drug alone. It may be prudent to examine blood ammonia levels\r\nin patients in whom the onset of hypothermia has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.10)]."

Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for\r\nany indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, but also\r\nmalformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations).\r\nThe risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital\r\nmalformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has\r\nbeen shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who\r\nused other anti-seizure monotherapies.\r\nSeveral published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero\r\nhave lower cognitive test scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or\r\nto no antiepileptic drugs in utero. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\r\nIn animal studies, offspring had structural malformations similar to those seen in humans and\r\ndemonstrated behavioral deficits.\r\nClinical Considerations\r\nâ€¢ Neural tube defects are the congenital malformation most strongly associated with maternal\r\nvalproate use. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure is generally\r\nestimated as 1-2%, compared to an estimated general population risk for spina bifida of about\r\n0.06 to 0.07% (6 to 7 in 10,000 births).\r\nâ€¢ To prevent major seizures, women with epilepsy should not discontinue Depakote ER abruptly,\r\nas this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to\r\nlife. Even minor seizures may pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus. However,\r\ndiscontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy in individual\r\ncases if the seizure disorder severity and frequency do not pose a serious threat to the patient.\r\nâ€¢ Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered\r\nto pregnant women using valproate.\r\nâ€¢ Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first\r\ntrimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general\r\npopulation. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects in the offspring of women\r\nreceiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation\r\nboth prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients\r\nusing valproate.\r\nâ€¢ Patients taking valproate may develop clotting abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions\r\n(5.6)]. A patient who had low fibrinogen when taking multiple anticonvulsants including valproate gave birth to an infant with afibrinogenemia who subsequently died of hemorrhage. If\r\nvalproate is used in pregnancy, the clotting parameters should be monitored carefully.\r\nâ€¢ Patients taking valproate may develop hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1),\r\nBoxed Warning]. Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have\r\nalso been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy.\r\nData\r\nHuman\r\nThere is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that exposure to valproate in utero increases\r\nthe risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities. Based on published data from the\r\nCDCâ€™s National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spina bifida in the general population is\r\nabout 0.06 to 0.07%. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure has been\r\nestimated to be approximately 1 to 2%.\r\nIn one study using NAAED Pregnancy Registry data, 16 cases of major malformations following\r\nprenatal valproate exposure were reported among offspring of 149 enrolled women who used\r\nvalproate during pregnancy. Three of the 16 cases were neural tube defects; the remaining cases\r\nincluded craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and malformations of varying severity\r\ninvolving other body systems. The NAAED Pregnancy Registry has reported a major malformation\r\nrate of 10.7% (95% C.I. 6.3% â€“ 16.9%) in the offspring of women exposed to an average of 1,000\r\nmg/day of valproate monotherapy during pregnancy (dose range 500 â€“ 2000 mg/day). The major\r\nmalformation rate among the internal comparison group of 1,048 epileptic women who received any\r\nother antiepileptic drug monotherapy during pregnancy was 2.9% (95% CI 2.0% to 4.1%). These data\r\nshow a four-fold increased risk for any major malformation (Odds Ratio 4.0; 95% CI 2.1 to 7.4)\r\nfollowing valproate exposure in utero compared to the risk following exposure in utero to any other\r\nantiepileptic drug monotherapy.\r\nSeveral published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero\r\nhave lower cognitive test scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or\r\nto no antiepileptic drugs in utero. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study\r\nconducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to\r\nvalproate had lower Differential Ability Scale (D.A.S.) scores at age 3 (92 [95% C.I. 88-97]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other anti-epileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated:\r\nlamotrigine (101 [95% C.I. 98-104]), carbamazepine (98 [95% C.I. 95-102]) and phenytoin (99 [95%\r\nC.I. 94-104)]. The D.A.S., which has a mean score of 100 (SD = 15), is a battery of cognitive tests\r\ndesigned for children ages 2.5 to 17 years. The D.A.S. is a measure of neurobehavioral development\r\nperformed when children are too young to undergo IQ testing and generally correlates with IQ scores\r\nlater in childhood.\r\nAlthough all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence\r\nsupports a causal association between valproate exposure in utero and subsequent adverse effects\r\non cognitive development.\r\nThere are published case reports of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate\r\nduring pregnancy.\r\nAnimal\r\nIn developmental toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, increased rates of\r\nfetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death occurred\r\nfollowing treatment of pregnant animals with valproate during organogenesis at clinically relevant\r\ndoses (calculated on a body surface area basis). Valproate induced malformations of multiple organ\r\nsystems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, in addition to other\r\nmalformations, fetal neural tube defects have been reported following valproate administration during\r\ncritical periods of organogenesis, and the teratogenic response correlated with peak maternal drug\r\nlevels. Behavioral abnormalities (including cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits) and\r\nbrain histopathological changes have also been reported in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally\r\nto clinically relevant doses of valproate.\r\n8.3 Nursing Mothers\r\nValproate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when valproate is administered to\r\na nursing woman.\r\n8.4 Pediatric Use\r\nExperience has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk\r\nof developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions [see Boxed Warning Warning and Precautions (5.1)]. When valproate is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme\r\ncaution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above the age of 2\r\nyears, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in\r\nprogressively older patient groups.\r\nYounger children, especially those receiving enzyme inducing drugs, will require larger maintenance doses to\r\nattain targeted total and unbound valproate concentrations. Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10\r\nyears) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults. Over the age of 10\r\nyears, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults.\r\nThe variability in free fraction limits the clinical usefulness of monitoring total serum valproic acid\r\nconcentration. Interpretation of valproic acid concentrations in children should include consideration of factors\r\nthat affect hepatic metabolism and protein binding.\r\nPediatric Clinical Trials\r\nDepakote was studied in seven pediatric clinical trials.\r\nTwo of the pediatric studies were double-blinded placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of Depakote\r\nER for the indications of mania (150 patients aged 10 to 17 years, 76 of whom were on Depakote ER) and\r\nmigraine (304 patients aged 12 to 17 years, 231 of whom were on Depakote ER). Efficacy was not established\r\nfor either the treatment of migraine or the treatment of mania.\r\nThe remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two six-month pediatric studies were conducted to\r\nevaluate the long-term safety of Depakote ER for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years).\r\nTwo twelve-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of Depakote ER for the\r\nindication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years). One twelve-month study was conducted to evaluate\r\nthe safety of Depakote Sprinkle Capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged 3 to 10 years).\r\nThe safety and tolerability of Depakote in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults [see\r\nAdverse Reactions (6)].\r\nNonclinical Developmental Toxicology\r\nIn studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included\r\nretinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in\r\nrats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The no-effect dose for\r\nthese findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis.\r\n8.5 Geriatric Use\r\nNo patients above the age of 65 years were enrolled in double-blind prospective clinical trials of\r\nmania associated with bipolar illness. In a case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12%) were\r\ngreater than 65 years of age. A higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported\r\naccidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor.\r\nDiscontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear\r\nwhether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from preexisting medical illness\r\nand concomitant medication use among these patients.\r\nA study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for\r\nsomnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. The starting dose should be reduced in these\r\npatients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive\r\nsomnolence [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\r\nThere is insufficient information available to discern the safety and effectiveness of valproate for the\r\nprophylaxis of migraines in patients over 65.\r\nThe capacity of elderly patients (age range: 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to\r\nbe reduced compared to younger adults (age range: 22 to 26 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology\r\n(12.3)].\r\n8.6 Effect of Disease\r\nLiver Disease\r\n[(See Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5) and Clinical\r\nPharmacology (12.3)]. Liver disease impairs the capacity to eliminate valproate."

Cardiovascular Conditions\r\nBecause of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have\r\nvagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect\r\nmay manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and\r\nwithout known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal\r\nepisodes have been reported in association with the use of ARICEPT.\r\n\r\n5.3. Nausea and Vomiting\r\nARICEPT, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties,\r\nhas been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects,\r\nwhen they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with\r\nthe 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the\r\n10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23\r\nmg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10\r\nmg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg\r\ngroup was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10\r\nmg/day (11.8% vs 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the\r\n23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs 2.5%,\r\nrespectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to\r\nvomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group\r\n(2.9% vs 0.4%, respectively).\r\nAlthough in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient,\r\nsometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued\r\nuse of ARICEPT, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of\r\ntreatment and after dose increases.\r\n\r\n5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding\r\nThrough their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to\r\nincrease gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity.\r\nTherefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or\r\noccult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for\r\ndeveloping ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those\r\nreceiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\r\nClinical studies of ARICEPT in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have\r\nshown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic\r\nulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical\r\nstudy with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the\r\nincidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal\r\nbleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%)\r\n\r\n5.5. Weight Loss\r\nWeight loss was reported as an adverse event in 4.7% of patients assigned\r\nto ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned\r\nto 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking\r\n23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of â‰¥ 7% by the end of the\r\nstudy, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight\r\nloss of â‰¥ 7% at the end of the study.\r\n\r\n5.6. Genitourinary Conditions\r\nAlthough not observed in clinical trials of ARICEPT, cholinomimetics may\r\ncause bladder outflow obstruction.\r\n\r\n5.7. Neurological Conditions: Seizures\r\nCholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized\r\nconvulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of\r\nAlzheimerâ€™s disease.\r\n\r\n5.8. Pulmonary Conditions\r\nBecause of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be\r\nprescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive\r\npulmonary disease.

Clinical Studies Experience\r\nARICEPT 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day\r\nMild to Moderate Alzheimerâ€™s Disease\r\nAdverse Events Leading to Discontinuation\r\nThe rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due\r\nto adverse events for the ARICEPT 5 mg/day treatment groups were\r\ncomparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The\r\nrate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from\r\n5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%.\r\nThe most common adverse events leading to discontinuation, defined as\r\nthose occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence\r\nseen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.\r\nTable 1.

These include\r\nnausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia.\r\nThese adverse events were often of mild intensity and transient, resolving\r\nduring continued ARICEPT treatment without the need for dose\r\nmodification.\r\nThere is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse\r\nevents may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was\r\nconducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week\r\nstudies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week\r\nperiod. The rates of common adverse events were lower than those seen in\r\npatients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials\r\nand were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day.\r\nSee Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse events following\r\none and six week titration regimens.\r\nTable 2.

Approximately 1200 of these patients have been treated\r\nfor at least 3 months and more than 1000 patients have been treated for at\r\nleast 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States\r\nincluded approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of\r\n10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475\r\npatients treated for 6 months and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The\r\nrange of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days.\r\nTreatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three\r\ncontrolled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were\r\nrecorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology\r\nof their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of\r\nindividuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a\r\nsmaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART\r\ndictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These\r\ncategories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the\r\nproportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event\r\nwhile receiving ARICEPT. All adverse events occurring at least twice are\r\nincluded, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms\r\ntoo general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events\r\nare classified by body system and listed using the following definitions:\r\nFrequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients;\r\nInfrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients.\r\nThese adverse events are not necessarily related to ARICEPT treatment and\r\nin most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated\r\npatients in the controlled studies.

Effect of ARICEPT on the Metabolism of Other Drugs\r\nNo in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of ARICEPT on the\r\nclearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or\r\nby CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate\r\nof binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 ï­M), that, given the\r\ntherapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little\r\nlikelihood of interference.\r\nWhether ARICEPT has any potential for enzyme induction is not known.\r\nFormal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of ARICEPT for\r\ninteraction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and\r\nketoconazole. No effects of ARICEPT on the pharmacokinetics of these\r\ndrugs were observed.\r\n\r\n7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of ARICEPT\r\nKetoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6,\r\nrespectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a\r\nclinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18\r\nhealthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil\r\n(5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical\r\nrelevance of this increase in concentration is unknown.\r\nA small effect of CYP2D6 inhibitors was identified in a population\r\npharmacokinetic analysis of plasma donepezil concentrations measured in\r\npatients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Donepezil clearance was reduced by\r\napproximately 17% in patients taking 10 or 23 mg in combination with a\r\nknown CYP2D6 inhibitor. This result is consistent with the conclusion that\r\nCYP2D6 is a minor metabolic pathway of donepezil.\r\nInducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine,\r\ndexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of\r\nelimination of ARICEPT.\r\nFormal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of\r\nARICEPT is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of\r\ndigoxin or cimetidine.\r\n\r\n7.3. Use with Anticholinergics\r\nBecause of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the\r\npotential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications.\r\n\r\n7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors\r\nA synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are\r\ngiven concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking\r\nagents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol.

Because of the risks of severe\r\nneutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, VERSACLOZ should be used only in patients\r\nwho have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1, 5.4)].\r\nThe effectiveness of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6Â­\r\nweek, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine and\r\nchlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\r\n\r\n1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or\r\nSchizoaffective Disorder\r\nVERSACLOZ is indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with\r\nschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for reexperiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior\r\nrefers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death.\r\nThe effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was\r\ndemonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePTâ„¢ trial [see Clinical Studies\r\n(14.2)]."

                            "Value": "2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy\r\nPrior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline\r\nANC must be at least 1500/ÂµL for the general population, and at least 1000/ÂµL for patients with\r\ndocumented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be\r\nmonitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\r\n\r\n2.2 Dosing Information\r\nThe starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in\r\nincrements of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose\r\ncan be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum\r\ndose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and\r\nsyncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided\r\ndosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\r\n\r\n2.3 Important Administration Instructions\r\nVERSACLOZ Oral Suspension is administered to the mouth by the oral syringes provided (1 mL\r\nor 9 mL). After shaking the bottle for 10 seconds prior to each use, the syringe adaptor is pressed\r\non top of the bottle. The oral syringe (1 mL or 9 mL) is filled with air, and inserted into the\r\nadaptor. The air is dispelled into the bottle and then the bottle is turned upside down. The\r\nprescribed amount of the suspension is drawn from the bottle and dispensed directly to the\r\nmouth. The prescribed dose should be administered immediately after it is prepared. Do not draw\r\na dose and store it in the syringe for later use. After use, the oral syringe may be washed with\r\nwarm water and dried for next use. The bottle may be closed with the same cap without\r\nremoving the bottle adaptor. Educate patients and caregivers on the steps to administer\r\nVERSACLOZ as described in the Patient Instructions for Use.\r\nVERSACLOZ can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].\r\n\r\n2.4 Maintenance Treatment\r\nGenerally, patients responding to VERSACLOZ should continue maintenance treatment on their\r\neffective dose beyond the acute episode.\r\n\r\n2.5 Discontinuation of Treatment\r\nMethod of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patientâ€™s last ANC:\r\nï‚·\t See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt\r\ntreatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia.\r\nï‚·\t Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of VERSACLOZ\r\ntherapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia.\r\nï‚·\t For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of\r\nthe existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their\r\nANC is â‰¥1500/ÂµL and for BEN patients until their ANC is â‰¥1000/ÂµL or above their baseline.\r\nï‚·\t Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature\r\nof 38.5Â°C or 101.3Â°F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1)].\r\nï‚·\t Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms\r\nrelated to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and\r\ndiarrhea.\r\n\r\n2.6 Re-Initiation of Treatment\r\nWhen restarting VERSACLOZ in patients who have discontinued VERSACLOZ (i.e., 2 days or\r\nmore since the last dose), re-initiate with 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions\r\n(5.3)]. If that dose is well tolerated, the dose may be increased to the previously therapeutic dose\r\nmore quickly than recommended for initial treatment.\r\n\r\n2.7 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors\r\nor CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers\r\nDose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2\r\ninhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors\r\n(e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine,\r\nescitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine,\r\nor sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. Johnâ€™s wort, and rifampin);\r\nor CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) (Table 1) [see Drug Interactions (7)].\r\nTable 1: Dose Adjustment in Patients Taking Concomitant Medications\r\nCo-medications Scenarios\r\n Initiating Adding a Discontinuing a\r\nVERSACLOZ co-medication co-medication\r\nwhile taking a while taking while continuing\r\nco-medication VERSACLOZ VERSACLOZ\r\nStrong CYP1A2 Use one third of the VERSACLOZ dose.

                            "Value": "5.1 Severe Neutropenia\r\nBackground\r\nVERSACLOZ can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count [ANC]), defined as a\r\nreduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available\r\nas a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant\r\nto drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be\r\ncalculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total\r\npercentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil â€œsegsâ€ plus neutrophil\r\nâ€œbandsâ€). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia\r\nand their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild,\r\nmoderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, â€œsevere\r\nneutropeniaâ€ replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or\r\nagranulocytosis.\r\nSevere neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/ÂµL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking\r\nVERSACLOZ and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal\r\ninfections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then\r\ndeclines. The mechanism by which VERSACLOZ causes neutropenia is unknown and is not\r\ndose-dependent.\r\nTwo separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general\r\npopulation, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia.\r\nVERSACLOZ Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2)\r\nObtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ to\r\nensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL) and\r\nto permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater\r\nthan (â‰¥)1500/ÂµL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate\r\ntreatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of\r\ntreatment. If a patientâ€™s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL for the first 6 months of\r\ntreatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the\r\nANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy,\r\nANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter.\r\nTable 2: VERSACLOZ Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count\r\n(ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population\r\nANC Level VERSACLOZ\r\nTreatment Recommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nNormal range\r\n(â‰¥1500/ÂµL)\r\nï‚· Initiate treatment\r\nï‚· If treatment interrupted:\r\n- <30 days, continue\r\nmonitoring as before\r\n- â‰¥30 days, monitor as if new\r\npatient\r\nï‚· Weekly from initiation to\r\n6 months\r\nï‚· Every 2 weeks from 6 to\r\n12 months\r\nï‚· Monthly after 12 months\r\nï‚· Discontinuation for reasons\r\nother than neutropenia\r\nï‚· See Section 2.4\r\nMild Neutropenia ï‚· Continue treatment ï‚· Three times weekly until\r\n(1000 to 1499/ÂµL)* ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL, return\r\nto patientâ€™s last â€œNormal\r\nRangeâ€ ANC monitoring\r\ninterval**\r\nModerate ï‚· Recommend hematology ï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL,\r\nNeutropenia consultation then\r\n(500 to 999/ÂµL)* ï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapine-induced\r\nneutropenia\r\nï‚· Resume treatment once ANC\r\nâ‰¥1000/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL, check\r\nANC weekly for 4 weeks,\r\nthen return to patientâ€™s last\r\nâ€œNormal Rangeâ€ ANC\r\nmonitoring interval**\r\nSevere Neutropenia ï‚· Recommend hematology ï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL,\r\n(less than 500/ÂµL)* consultation\r\nï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapine-induced\r\nneutropenia\r\nï‚· Do not rechallenge unless\r\nprescriber determines benefits\r\noutweigh risks\r\nthen\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· If patient rechallenged,\r\nresume treatment as a new\r\npatient under â€œNormal\r\nRangeâ€ monitoring once \r\nANC Level VERSACLOZ\r\nTreatment Recommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\n* Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/ÂµL with a repeat ANC measurement within\r\n24 hours\r\n** If clinically appropriate\r\nVERSACLOZ Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table\r\n3)\r\nBenign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average\r\nANC values are lower than â€œstandardâ€ laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly\r\nobserved in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle\r\nEastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more\r\ncommon in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid\r\nmaturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at\r\nincreased risk for developing VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be\r\nneeded to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation\r\nbefore initiating or during VERSACLOZ treatment as necessary.\r\nPatients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for VERSACLOZ management due to\r\ntheir lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing VERSACLOZ\r\ntreatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN.\r\nTable 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); VERSACLOZ Treatment\r\nRecommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring\r\nANC Level Treatment\r\nRecommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nNormal BEN Range\r\n(Established ANC\r\nbaseline â‰¥1000/ÂµL )\r\nï‚· Obtain at least two\r\nbaseline ANC levels\r\nbefore initiating\r\ntreatment\r\nï‚· If treatment interrupted\r\n- <30 days, continue\r\nmonitoring as\r\nbefore\r\n- â‰¥30 days, monitor\r\nas if new patient\r\nï‚· Weekly from initiation to\r\n6 months\r\nï‚· Every 2 weeks from 6 to\r\n12 months\r\nï‚· Monthly after 12 months\r\nï‚· Discontinuation of\r\ntreatment for reasons\r\nother than neutropenia\r\nï‚· See Section 2.4\r\nANC Level Treatment\r\nRecommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nBEN\r\nNeutropenia\r\n(500 to 999/ÂµL)*\r\nï‚· Recommend\r\nhematology\r\nconsultation\r\nï‚· Continue treatment\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until ANC\r\nâ‰¥1000/ÂµL or â‰¥patientâ€™s known\r\nbaseline\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL or at\r\npatientâ€™s known baseline, check\r\nANC weekly for 4 weeks, then\r\nreturn to patientâ€™s last â€œNormal\r\nBEN Rangeâ€ ANC monitoring\r\ninterval.**\r\nBEN\r\nSevere Neutropenia\r\n(less than 500/ÂµL)*\r\nï‚· Recommend\r\nhematology\r\nconsultation\r\nï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapineinduced neutropenia\r\nï‚· Do not rechallenge\r\nunless prescriber\r\ndetermines benefits\r\noutweigh risks\r\nï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥500/ÂµL, then\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until ANC â‰¥\r\npatientâ€™s baseline\r\nï‚· If patient rechallenged, resume\r\ntreatment as a new patient under\r\nâ€œNormal Rangeâ€ monitoring once\r\nANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL or at patientâ€™s\r\nbaseline\r\n* Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/ÂµL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours\r\n** If clinically appropriate\r\nGeneral Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia\r\nï‚·\t Fever: Interrupt VERSACLOZ as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops\r\nfever, defined as a temperature of 38.5Â°C [101.3Â°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level.\r\nFever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection.\r\nï‚·\t ANC less than 1000/ÂµL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/ÂµL,\r\ninitiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for\r\nmanagement.\r\nï‚·\t Consider hematology consultation.\r\nï‚·\t See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Fever under WARNINGS AND\r\nPRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING\r\nINFORMATION (17).\r\nRechallenge after an ANC less than 500/ÂµL (severe neutropenia)\r\nFor some patients who experience severe VERSACLOZ-related neutropenia, the risk of serious\r\npsychiatric illness from discontinuing VERSACLOZ treatment may be greater than the risk of\r\nrechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other\r\nthan VERSACLOZ). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a\r\npatient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with\r\nVERSACLOZ or a clozapine product.\r\nIf a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2\r\nand 3, the patientâ€™s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of VERSACLOZ rechallenge, and the severity and\r\ncharacteristics of the neutropenic episode.\r\nUsing VERSACLOZ with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia\r\nIt is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or\r\nseverity of VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid\r\nVERSACLOZ treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If VERSACLOZ is\r\nused concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic\r\nagents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in\r\nTables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant\r\nchemotherapy.\r\n\r\n5.2 Clozapine REMS Program\r\nVERSACLOZ is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine\r\nREMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia.\r\nNotable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include:\r\nï‚· Healthcare professionals who prescribe VERSACLOZ must be certified with the program by\r\nenrolling and completing training.\r\nï‚· Patients who receive VERSACLOZ must be enrolled in the program and comply with the\r\nANC testing and monitoring requirements.\r\nï‚· Pharmacies dispensing VERSACLOZ must be certified with the program by enrolling and\r\ncompleting training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive\r\nVERSACLOZ.\r\nFurther information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678.\r\n\r\n5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope\r\nHypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment.\r\nThe risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation.\r\nThese reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be\r\nfatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB).\r\nTreatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily\r\ndose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose\r\nof 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks.\r\nSubsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg.\r\nThe maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to\r\nminimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\r\nConsider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a\r\nbrief interval off VERSACLOZ (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at\r\n12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\r\nUse VERSACLOZ cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial\r\ninfarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and\r\nconditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of\r\nantihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia).\r\n\r\n5.4 Seizures\r\nSeizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence\r\nat one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of\r\n1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a\r\ncrude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5\r\nmg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing.\r\nUse caution when administering VERSACLOZ to patients with a history of seizures or other\r\npredisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of\r\nmedications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of\r\nseizure associated with VERSACLOZ use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where\r\nsudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an\r\nautomobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing).\r\n\r\n5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy\r\nMyocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be\r\nfatal. Discontinue VERSACLOZ and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis\r\nor cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or\r\ncardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with VERSACLOZ. However, if the benefit of\r\nVERSACLOZ treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or\r\ncardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with VERSACLOZ in consultation with\r\na cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring.\r\nConsider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving VERSACLOZ\r\nwho present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like\r\nsymptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic\r\nfindings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave\r\nprogression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine\r\ntreatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated\r\nmyocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy\r\ncan occur at any period during treatment with VERSACLOZ. It is common for nonspecific flulike symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede\r\nmore overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T,\r\nelevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).\r\nChest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging\r\n(echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left\r\nventricular dysfunction.\r\n\r\n5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\r\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an\r\nincreased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks),\r\nlargely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated\r\npatients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course\r\nof a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%,\r\ncompared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were\r\nvaried, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death)\r\nor infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical\r\nantipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in\r\nthis population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies\r\nmay be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is\r\nnot clear. VERSACLOZ is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related\r\npsychosis [see Boxed Warning].\r\n\r\n5.7 Eosinophilia\r\nEosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/ÂµL, has occurred with\r\nclozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia.\r\nClozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some\r\npatients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis.\r\nSuch organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic\r\nsymptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS).\r\nIf eosinophilia develops during VERSACLOZ treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and\r\nsymptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other\r\norgan-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is\r\nsuspected, discontinue VERSACLOZ immediately.\r\nIf a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen\r\nvascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and\r\ncontinue VERSACLOZ.\r\nClozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can\r\nresolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of\r\nclozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue\r\nVERSACLOZ under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over\r\nseveral weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt VERSACLOZ therapy\r\nand rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical\r\nassessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist.\r\n\r\n5.8 QT Interval Prolongation\r\nQT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac\r\narrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing\r\nVERSACLOZ, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious\r\ncardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac\r\ndeath, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure,\r\ntreatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ, and electrolyte abnormalities.\r\nPrior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ, perform a careful physical examination, medical\r\nhistory, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum\r\nchemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue VERSACLOZ if the QTc\r\ninterval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes\r\nor other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac\r\nevaluation and discontinue VERSACLOZ.\r\nUse caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific\r\nantipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine,\r\ndroperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin,\r\nsparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III\r\nantiarrhythmic (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate,\r\nmethadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus).\r\nVERSACLOZ is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant\r\ntreatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of VERSACLOZ [see\r\nDrug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\r\nHypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can\r\nresult from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk\r\nfor significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements\r\nof serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct\r\nelectrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ.\r\n\r\n5.9 Metabolic Changes\r\nAtypical antipsychotic drugs, including VERSACLOZ, have been associated with metabolic\r\nchanges that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes\r\ninclude hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs\r\nmay produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile.\r\nHyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus\r\nHyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma\r\nor death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including\r\nVERSACLOZ. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose\r\nabnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes\r\nmellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the\r\ngeneral population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use\r\nand hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However,\r\nepidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related\r\nadverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not\r\navailable.\r\nPatients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on VERSACLOZ\r\nshould be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for\r\ndiabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with\r\natypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of\r\ntreatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics\r\nshould be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia,\r\nand weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical\r\nantipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has\r\nresolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required\r\ncontinuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.\r\nIn a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in\r\nfasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and\r\n+4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical\r\nincreases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group\r\n(Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day).\r\nThe maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day).\r\nThe median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine.\r\nTable 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change\r\n(at least once) from\r\nbaseline\r\nTreatment Arm N n (%)\r\nNormal\r\n(<100 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27)\r\nFasting Glucose\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10)\r\nBorderline\r\n(100 to 125 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥126 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 57 24 (42)\r\nChlorpromazine 43 12 (28)\r\nDyslipidemia\r\nUndesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics,\r\nincluding VERSACLOZ. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid\r\nevaluations in patients using VERSACLOZ, is recommended.\r\nIn a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment\r\nwas associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and\r\nHDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group\r\nand 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult\r\nsubjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum\r\ntriglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine\r\ntreatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as\r\nillustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or\r\nfasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine\r\nand chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range\r\nwas 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.\r\nTable 5: Mean Changes in Total Cholesterol and Triglyceride Concentration in Studies in\r\nAdult Subjects with Schizophrenia\r\nTreatment Arm Baseline total cholesterol\r\nconcentration (mg/dL)\r\nChange from baseline\r\nmg/dL (%)\r\nClozapine (N=334) 184 +13 (7)\r\nChlorpromazine (N=185) 182 +15 (8)\r\nBaseline triglyceride\r\nconcentration (mg/dL)\r\nChange from baseline\r\nmg/dL (%)\r\nClozapine (N=6) 130 +71 (54)\r\nChlorpromazine (N=7) 110 +39 (35)\r\nTable 6: Categorical Changes in Lipid Concentrations in Studies in Adult Subjects with\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change (at\r\nleast once) from\r\nBaseline\r\nTreatment\r\nArm N n (%)\r\nTotal\r\nCholesterol\r\n(random or\r\nfasting)\r\nIncrease by â‰¥40 mg/dL\r\nClozapine 334 111 (33)\r\nChlorpromazine 185 46 (25)\r\nNormal (<200 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥240 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 222 18 (8)\r\nChlorpromazine 132 3 (2)\r\nBorderline\r\n(200 - 239 mg/dL) to\r\nHigh (â‰¥240 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 79 30 (38)\r\nChlorpromazine 34 14 (41)\r\nTriglycerides\r\n(fasting)\r\nIncrease by â‰¥50 mg/dL\r\nClozapine 6 3 (50)\r\nChlorpromazine 7 3 (43)\r\nNormal (<150 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥200 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 4 0 (0)\r\nChlorpromazine 6 2 (33)\r\nBorderline\r\n(â‰¥150 mg/dL and Clozapine 1 1 (100)\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change (at\r\nleast once) from\r\nBaseline\r\nTreatment\r\nArm N n (%)\r\n<200 mg/dL) to\r\nHigh (â‰¥200 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 1 0 (0)\r\nWeight Gain\r\nWeight gain has occurred with the use of antipsychotics, including VERSACLOZ.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include\r\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or\r\nblood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can\r\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal\r\nfailure.\r\nThe diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to\r\nconsider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection,\r\nheat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms,\r\nand drug fever).\r\nThe management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs\r\nand other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and\r\nmedical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general\r\nagreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS.\r\nIf a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential\r\nreintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if\r\nrestarting treatment with antipsychotics.\r\nNMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications,\r\nincluding lithium.\r\n\r\n5.11 Fever\r\nDuring clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak\r\nincidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and selflimited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase\r\nor decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia\r\nor infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].\r\n\r\n5.12 Pulmonary Embolism\r\nPulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine.\r\nConsider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep vein\r\nthrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether\r\npulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some\r\ncharacteristic(s) of patients is not clear.\r\n\r\n5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity\r\nVERSACLOZ has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with VERSACLOZ can result in\r\nCNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle\r\nglaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in\r\nwhich anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions.\r\nTreatment with VERSACLOZ can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including\r\nconstipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be\r\nfatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary\r\ntherapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more\r\nserious cases.\r\n\r\n5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance\r\nVERSACLOZ can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution\r\npatients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably\r\ncertain that VERSACLOZ does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related.\r\nConsider reducing the dose if they occur.\r\n\r\n5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia\r\nTardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including\r\nVERSACLOZ. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic\r\nmovements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to\r\nincrease with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the\r\nsyndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe\r\nVERSACLOZ in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the\r\nlowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically\r\nassess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs.\r\nHowever, some patients may require treatment with VERSACLOZ despite the presence of the\r\nsyndrome.\r\nThere is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely\r\nif treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress)\r\nthe signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of\r\nsymptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown.\r\n\r\n5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions\r\nIn controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical\r\nantipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions\r\n(e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased\r\nrisk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for VERSACLOZ or other\r\nantipsychotics or other patient populations. VERSACLOZ should be used with caution in\r\npatients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.\r\n\r\n5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of\r\nVERSACLOZ\r\nIf abrupt discontinuation of VERSACLOZ is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or\r\nanother medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse\r\nreactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting,\r\nand diarrhea.

                            "Value": "7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect VERSACLOZ\r\nClozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4,\r\nand CYP2D6. Use caution when administering VERSACLOZ concomitantly with drugs that are\r\ninducers or inhibitors of these enzymes.\r\nCYP1A2 Inhibitors\r\nConcomitant use of VERSACLOZ and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of\r\nclozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the VERSACLOZ dose to one third\r\nof the original dose when VERSACLOZ is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g.,\r\nfluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The VERSACLOZ dose should be increased to the\r\noriginal dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage\r\nand Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\r\nModerate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients\r\nclosely when VERSACLOZ is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the\r\nVERSACLOZ dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nCYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors\r\nConcomitant treatment with VERSACLOZ and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g.,\r\ncimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine,\r\nterbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical\r\nPharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors.\r\nConsider reducing the VERSACLOZ dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nCYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers\r\nConcomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma\r\nconcentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of VERSACLOZ. Tobacco\r\nsmoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine,\r\nphenytoin, St. Johnâ€™s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the VERSACLOZ dose\r\nif used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of\r\nVERSACLOZ and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and\r\nAdministration (2.7)].\r\nConsider reducing the VERSACLOZ dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme\r\ninducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and\r\nan increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nDrugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation\r\nUse caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific\r\nantipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin,\r\nsparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III\r\nantiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate,\r\nmethadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see\r\nWarnings and Precautions (5.8)].\r\n\r\n7.2 Potential for VERSACLOZ to Affect Other Drugs\r\nConcomitant use of VERSACLOZ with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels\r\nof these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering VERSACLOZ with other drugs\r\nthat are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than\r\nusually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine,\r\nand Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide). "

Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of\r\npregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery.\r\nMonitor neonates for symptoms of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence,\r\nrespiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The severity of complications can vary from selflimited symptoms to some neonates requiring intensive care unit support and prolonged\r\nhospitalization.\r\nAnimal Data\r\nIn embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter\r\nsizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period\r\nof organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a\r\nmg/m2 body surface area basis. \r\nIn peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over\r\nthe last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at\r\nbirth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and\r\nmated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or\r\nbody weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day\r\non a mg/m2 body surface area basis.\r\n\r\n8.3 Nursing Mothers\r\nVERSACLOZ is present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in\r\nnursing infants from VERSACLOZ, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing\r\nor to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\n\r\n8.4 Pediatric Use\r\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n\r\n8.5 Geriatric Use\r\nThere have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing\r\nVERSACLOZ to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in\r\ntheir response to VERSACLOZ.\r\nOrthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning\r\nand Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised\r\ncardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects.\r\nElderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such\r\nas urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].\r\nCarefully select VERSACLOZ doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater\r\nfrequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease\r\nand other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia\r\nappears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.15)].\r\n\r\n8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment\r\nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic\r\nfunction. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is\r\nalmost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Clinical\r\nPharmacology (12.3)].\r\n\r\n8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers\r\nDose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine\r\nconcentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Clinical Pharmacology\r\n(12.3)].\r\n\r\n8.8 Hospice Patients\r\nFor hospice patients (i.e., terminally ill patients with an estimated life expectancy of 6 months or\r\nless), the prescriber may reduce the ANC monitoring frequency to once every 6 months, after a\r\ndiscussion with the patient and his/her caregiver. Individual treatment decisions should weigh the\r\nimportance of monitoring ANC in the context of the need to control psychiatric symptoms and\r\nthe patientâ€™s terminal illness. "

If the\r\nparkinsonian effect begins to return, the dose can be repeated.\r\nBecause of cumulative action, therapy should be initiated with a low dose which is\r\nincreased gradually at five or six-day intervals to the smallest amount necessary for\r\noptimal relief. Increases should be made in increments of 0.5 mg, to a maximum of\r\n6 mg, or until optimal results are obtained without excessive adverse reactions.\r\nPostencephalitic and Idiopathic Parkinsonism: The following dosing guidelines\r\nwere written in reference to both benztropine mesylate tablets and COGENTIN\r\nInjection. Benztropine mesylate tablets should be used when patients are able to\r\ntake oral medication.\r\nThe usual daily dose is 1 to 2 mg, with a range of 0.5 to 6 mg parenterally.\r\nAs with any agent used in parkinsonism, dosage must be individualized according to\r\nage and weight, and the type of parkinsonism being treated. Generally, older\r\npatients, and thin patients cannot tolerate large doses. Most patients with\r\npostencephalitic parkinsonism need fairly large doses and tolerate them well.\r\nPatients with a poor mental outlook are usually poor candidates for therapy.\r\nIn idiopathic parkinsonism, therapy may be initiated with a single daily dose of 0.5 to\r\n1 mg at bedtime. In some patients, this will be adequate; in others 4 to 6 mg a day\r\nmay be required.\r\nIn postencephalitic parkinsonism, therapy may be initiated in most patients with 2 mg\r\na day in one or more doses. In highly sensitive patients, therapy may be initiated\r\nwith 0.5 mg at bedtime, and increased as necessary.\r\nSome patients experience greatest relief when given the entire dose at bedtime;\r\nothers react more favorably to divided doses, two to four times a day. Frequently,\r\none dose a day is sufficient, and divided doses may be unnecessary or undesirable.\r\nThe long duration of action of this drug makes it particularly suitable for bedtime\r\nmedication when its effects may last throughout the night, enabling patients to turn in\r\nbed during the night more easily, and to rise in the morning.\r\nWhen COGENTIN is started, do not terminate therapy with other antiparkinsonian\r\nagents abruptly. If the other agents are to be reduced or discontinued, it must be\r\ndone gradually. Many patients obtain greatest relief with combination therapy.\r\nCOGENTIN may be used concomitantly with SINEMET (CcarbidopaLevodopalevodopa), or with levodopa, in which case dosage adjustment may be\r\nrequired in order to maintain optimum response.\r\nDrug-Induced Extrapyramidal Disorders: In treating extrapyramidal disorders due\r\nto neuroleptic drugs (e.g., phenothiazines), the recommended dosage is 1 to 4 mg\r\nonce or twice a day parenterally. Dosage must be individualized according to the\r\nneed of the patient. Some patients require more than recommended; others do not\r\nneed as much.\r\nIn acute dystonic reactions, 1 to 2 mL of the injection usually relieves the condition\r\nquickly.\r\nWhen extrapyramidal disorders develop soon after initiation of treatment with\r\nneuroleptic drugs (e.g., phenothiazines), they are likely to be transient. One to 2 mg\r\nof COGENTIN two or three times a day usually provides relief within one or two days.\r\nIf such disorders recur, COGENTIN can be reinstituted.\r\nCertain drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders that develop slowly may not respond to COGENTIN."

                            "Value": "Safe use in pregnancy has not been established.\r\nCOGENTIN may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of\r\nhazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle.\r\nWhen COGENTIN is given concomitantly with phenothiazines, haloperidol, or other\r\ndrugs with anticholinergic or antidopaminergic activity, patients should be advised to\r\nreport gastrointestinal complaints, fever or heat intolerance promptly. Paralytic ileus,\r\nhyperthermia and heat stroke, all of which have sometimes been fatal, have occurred\r\nin patients taking anticholinergic-type antiparkinsonism drugs, including COGENTIN,\r\nin combination with phenothiazines and/or tricyclic antidepressants.\r\nSince COGENTIN contains structural features of atropine, it may produce anhidrosis.\r\nFor this reason, it should be administered with caution during hot weather, especially\r\nwhen given concomitantly with other atropine-like drugs to the chronically ill, the\r\nalcoholic, those who have central nervous system disease, and those who do\r\nmanual labor in a hot environment. Anhidrosis may occur more readily when some\r\ndisturbance of sweating already exists. If there is evidence of anhidrosis, the\r\npossibility of hyperthermia should be considered. Dosage should be decreased at\r\nthe discretion of the physician so that the ability to maintain body heat equilibrium by perspiration is not impaired. Severe anhidrosis and fatal hyperthermia have\r\noccurred.\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\nGeneral: Since COGENTIN has cumulative action, continued supervision is\r\nadvisable. Patients with a tendency to tachycardia and patients with prostatic\r\nhypertrophy should be observed closely during treatment.\r\nDysuria may occur, but rarely becomes a problem. Urinary retention has been\r\nreported with COGENTIN.\r\nThe drug may cause complaints of weakness and inability to move particular muscle\r\ngroups, especially in large doses. For example, if the neck has been rigid and\r\nsuddenly relaxes, it may feel weak, causing some concern. In this event, dosage\r\nadjustment is required.\r\nMental confusion and excitement may occur with large doses, or in susceptible\r\npatients. Visual hallucinations have been reported occasionally. Furthermore, in the\r\ntreatment of extrapyramidal disorders due to neuroleptic drugs (e.g.,\r\nphenothiazines), in patients with mental disorders, occasionally there may be\r\nintensification of mental symptoms. In such cases, antiparkinsonian drugs can\r\nprecipitate a toxic psychosis. Patients with mental disorders should be kept under\r\ncareful observation, especially at the beginning of treatment or if dosage is\r\nincreased.\r\nTardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy with\r\nphenothiazines and related agents, or may occur after therapy with these drugs have\r\nbeen discontinued. Antiparkinsonism agents do not alleviate the symptoms of\r\ntardive dyskinesia, and in some instances may aggravate them. COGENTIN is not\r\nrecommended for use in patients with tardive dyskinesia.\r\nThe physician should be aware of the possible occurrence of glaucoma. Although\r\nthe drug does not appear to have any adverse effect on simple glaucoma, it probably\r\nshould not be used in angle-closure glaucoma.\r\nDrug Interactions: Antipsychotic drugs such as phenothiazines or haloperidol;\r\ntricyclic antidepressants (see WARNINGS).\r\nPediatric Use: Because of the atropine-like side effects, COGENTIN should be\r\nused with caution in pediatric patients over three years of age (see\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS).\r\nGeriatric Use: Clinical studies of COGENTIN did not include sufficient numbers of\r\nsubjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in\r\nresponses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for\r\nan elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range (see DOSAGE AND\r\nADMINISTRATION) and the dose should be increased only as needed with\r\nmonitoring for the emergence of adverse events (see PRECAUTIONS and\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS)."

Because of the risks of severe\r\nneutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, VERSACLOZ should be used only in patients\r\nwho have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1, 5.4)].\r\nThe effectiveness of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6Â­\r\nweek, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine and\r\nchlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\r\n\r\n1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or\r\nSchizoaffective Disorder\r\nVERSACLOZ is indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with\r\nschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for reexperiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior\r\nrefers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death.\r\nThe effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was\r\ndemonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePTâ„¢ trial [see Clinical Studies\r\n(14.2)]."

                            "Value": "2.1 Required Laboratory Testing Prior to Initiation and During Therapy\r\nPrior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ, a baseline ANC must be obtained. The baseline\r\nANC must be at least 1500/ÂµL for the general population, and at least 1000/ÂµL for patients with\r\ndocumented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be\r\nmonitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\r\n\r\n2.2 Dosing Information\r\nThe starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in\r\nincrements of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose\r\ncan be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum\r\ndose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and\r\nsyncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided\r\ndosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\r\n\r\n2.3 Important Administration Instructions\r\nVERSACLOZ Oral Suspension is administered to the mouth by the oral syringes provided (1 mL\r\nor 9 mL). After shaking the bottle for 10 seconds prior to each use, the syringe adaptor is pressed\r\non top of the bottle. The oral syringe (1 mL or 9 mL) is filled with air, and inserted into the\r\nadaptor. The air is dispelled into the bottle and then the bottle is turned upside down. The\r\nprescribed amount of the suspension is drawn from the bottle and dispensed directly to the\r\nmouth. The prescribed dose should be administered immediately after it is prepared. Do not draw\r\na dose and store it in the syringe for later use. After use, the oral syringe may be washed with\r\nwarm water and dried for next use. The bottle may be closed with the same cap without\r\nremoving the bottle adaptor. Educate patients and caregivers on the steps to administer\r\nVERSACLOZ as described in the Patient Instructions for Use.\r\nVERSACLOZ can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].\r\n\r\n2.4 Maintenance Treatment\r\nGenerally, patients responding to VERSACLOZ should continue maintenance treatment on their\r\neffective dose beyond the acute episode.\r\n\r\n2.5 Discontinuation of Treatment\r\nMethod of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patientâ€™s last ANC:\r\nï‚·\t See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt\r\ntreatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia.\r\nï‚·\t Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of VERSACLOZ\r\ntherapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia.\r\nï‚·\t For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of\r\nthe existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their\r\nANC is â‰¥1500/ÂµL and for BEN patients until their ANC is â‰¥1000/ÂµL or above their baseline.\r\nï‚·\t Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature\r\nof 38.5Â°C or 101.3Â°F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1)].\r\nï‚·\t Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms\r\nrelated to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and\r\ndiarrhea.\r\n\r\n2.6 Re-Initiation of Treatment\r\nWhen restarting VERSACLOZ in patients who have discontinued VERSACLOZ (i.e., 2 days or\r\nmore since the last dose), re-initiate with 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions\r\n(5.3)]. If that dose is well tolerated, the dose may be increased to the previously therapeutic dose\r\nmore quickly than recommended for initial treatment.\r\n\r\n2.7 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors\r\nor CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers\r\nDose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2\r\ninhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors\r\n(e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine,\r\nescitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine,\r\nor sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. Johnâ€™s wort, and rifampin);\r\nor CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) (Table 1) [see Drug Interactions (7)].\r\nTable 1: Dose Adjustment in Patients Taking Concomitant Medications\r\nCo-medications Scenarios\r\n Initiating Adding a Discontinuing a\r\nVERSACLOZ co-medication co-medication\r\nwhile taking a while taking while continuing\r\nco-medication VERSACLOZ VERSACLOZ\r\nStrong CYP1A2 Use one third of the VERSACLOZ dose.

                            "Value": "5.1 Severe Neutropenia\r\nBackground\r\nVERSACLOZ can cause neutropenia (a low absolute neutrophil count [ANC]), defined as a\r\nreduction below pre-treatment normal levels of blood neutrophils. The ANC is usually available\r\nas a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant\r\nto drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be\r\ncalculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total\r\npercentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil â€œsegsâ€ plus neutrophil\r\nâ€œbandsâ€). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia\r\nand their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild,\r\nmoderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, â€œsevere\r\nneutropeniaâ€ replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or\r\nagranulocytosis.\r\nSevere neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/ÂµL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking\r\nVERSACLOZ and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal\r\ninfections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then\r\ndeclines. The mechanism by which VERSACLOZ causes neutropenia is unknown and is not\r\ndose-dependent.\r\nTwo separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general\r\npopulation, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia.\r\nVERSACLOZ Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2)\r\nObtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ to\r\nensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL) and\r\nto permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater\r\nthan (â‰¥)1500/ÂµL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate\r\ntreatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of\r\ntreatment. If a patientâ€™s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL for the first 6 months of\r\ntreatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the\r\nANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy,\r\nANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter.\r\nTable 2: VERSACLOZ Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count\r\n(ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population\r\nANC Level VERSACLOZ\r\nTreatment Recommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nNormal range\r\n(â‰¥1500/ÂµL)\r\nï‚· Initiate treatment\r\nï‚· If treatment interrupted:\r\n- <30 days, continue\r\nmonitoring as before\r\n- â‰¥30 days, monitor as if new\r\npatient\r\nï‚· Weekly from initiation to\r\n6 months\r\nï‚· Every 2 weeks from 6 to\r\n12 months\r\nï‚· Monthly after 12 months\r\nï‚· Discontinuation for reasons\r\nother than neutropenia\r\nï‚· See Section 2.4\r\nMild Neutropenia ï‚· Continue treatment ï‚· Three times weekly until\r\n(1000 to 1499/ÂµL)* ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL, return\r\nto patientâ€™s last â€œNormal\r\nRangeâ€ ANC monitoring\r\ninterval**\r\nModerate ï‚· Recommend hematology ï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL,\r\nNeutropenia consultation then\r\n(500 to 999/ÂµL)* ï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapine-induced\r\nneutropenia\r\nï‚· Resume treatment once ANC\r\nâ‰¥1000/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL, check\r\nANC weekly for 4 weeks,\r\nthen return to patientâ€™s last\r\nâ€œNormal Rangeâ€ ANC\r\nmonitoring interval**\r\nSevere Neutropenia ï‚· Recommend hematology ï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL,\r\n(less than 500/ÂµL)* consultation\r\nï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapine-induced\r\nneutropenia\r\nï‚· Do not rechallenge unless\r\nprescriber determines benefits\r\noutweigh risks\r\nthen\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· If patient rechallenged,\r\nresume treatment as a new\r\npatient under â€œNormal\r\nRangeâ€ monitoring once \r\nANC Level VERSACLOZ\r\nTreatment Recommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\n* Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/ÂµL with a repeat ANC measurement within\r\n24 hours\r\n** If clinically appropriate\r\nVERSACLOZ Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table\r\n3)\r\nBenign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average\r\nANC values are lower than â€œstandardâ€ laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly\r\nobserved in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle\r\nEastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more\r\ncommon in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid\r\nmaturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at\r\nincreased risk for developing VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be\r\nneeded to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation\r\nbefore initiating or during VERSACLOZ treatment as necessary.\r\nPatients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for VERSACLOZ management due to\r\ntheir lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing VERSACLOZ\r\ntreatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN.\r\nTable 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); VERSACLOZ Treatment\r\nRecommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring\r\nANC Level Treatment\r\nRecommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nNormal BEN Range\r\n(Established ANC\r\nbaseline â‰¥1000/ÂµL )\r\nï‚· Obtain at least two\r\nbaseline ANC levels\r\nbefore initiating\r\ntreatment\r\nï‚· If treatment interrupted\r\n- <30 days, continue\r\nmonitoring as\r\nbefore\r\n- â‰¥30 days, monitor\r\nas if new patient\r\nï‚· Weekly from initiation to\r\n6 months\r\nï‚· Every 2 weeks from 6 to\r\n12 months\r\nï‚· Monthly after 12 months\r\nï‚· Discontinuation of\r\ntreatment for reasons\r\nother than neutropenia\r\nï‚· See Section 2.4\r\nANC Level Treatment\r\nRecommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nBEN\r\nNeutropenia\r\n(500 to 999/ÂµL)*\r\nï‚· Recommend\r\nhematology\r\nconsultation\r\nï‚· Continue treatment\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until ANC\r\nâ‰¥1000/ÂµL or â‰¥patientâ€™s known\r\nbaseline\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL or at\r\npatientâ€™s known baseline, check\r\nANC weekly for 4 weeks, then\r\nreturn to patientâ€™s last â€œNormal\r\nBEN Rangeâ€ ANC monitoring\r\ninterval.**\r\nBEN\r\nSevere Neutropenia\r\n(less than 500/ÂµL)*\r\nï‚· Recommend\r\nhematology\r\nconsultation\r\nï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapineinduced neutropenia\r\nï‚· Do not rechallenge\r\nunless prescriber\r\ndetermines benefits\r\noutweigh risks\r\nï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥500/ÂµL, then\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until ANC â‰¥\r\npatientâ€™s baseline\r\nï‚· If patient rechallenged, resume\r\ntreatment as a new patient under\r\nâ€œNormal Rangeâ€ monitoring once\r\nANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL or at patientâ€™s\r\nbaseline\r\n* Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/ÂµL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours\r\n** If clinically appropriate\r\nGeneral Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia\r\nï‚·\t Fever: Interrupt VERSACLOZ as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops\r\nfever, defined as a temperature of 38.5Â°C [101.3Â°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level.\r\nFever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection.\r\nï‚·\t ANC less than 1000/ÂµL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/ÂµL,\r\ninitiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for\r\nmanagement.\r\nï‚·\t Consider hematology consultation.\r\nï‚·\t See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Fever under WARNINGS AND\r\nPRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING\r\nINFORMATION (17).\r\nRechallenge after an ANC less than 500/ÂµL (severe neutropenia)\r\nFor some patients who experience severe VERSACLOZ-related neutropenia, the risk of serious\r\npsychiatric illness from discontinuing VERSACLOZ treatment may be greater than the risk of\r\nrechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other\r\nthan VERSACLOZ). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a\r\npatient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with\r\nVERSACLOZ or a clozapine product.\r\nIf a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2\r\nand 3, the patientâ€™s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of VERSACLOZ rechallenge, and the severity and\r\ncharacteristics of the neutropenic episode.\r\nUsing VERSACLOZ with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia\r\nIt is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or\r\nseverity of VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid\r\nVERSACLOZ treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If VERSACLOZ is\r\nused concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic\r\nagents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in\r\nTables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant\r\nchemotherapy.\r\n\r\n5.2 Clozapine REMS Program\r\nVERSACLOZ is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine\r\nREMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia.\r\nNotable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include:\r\nï‚· Healthcare professionals who prescribe VERSACLOZ must be certified with the program by\r\nenrolling and completing training.\r\nï‚· Patients who receive VERSACLOZ must be enrolled in the program and comply with the\r\nANC testing and monitoring requirements.\r\nï‚· Pharmacies dispensing VERSACLOZ must be certified with the program by enrolling and\r\ncompleting training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive\r\nVERSACLOZ.\r\nFurther information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678.\r\n\r\n5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope\r\nHypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment.\r\nThe risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation.\r\nThese reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be\r\nfatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB).\r\nTreatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily\r\ndose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose\r\nof 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks.\r\nSubsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg.\r\nThe maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to\r\nminimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\r\nConsider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a\r\nbrief interval off VERSACLOZ (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at\r\n12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\r\nUse VERSACLOZ cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial\r\ninfarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and\r\nconditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of\r\nantihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia).\r\n\r\n5.4 Seizures\r\nSeizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence\r\nat one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of\r\n1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a\r\ncrude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5\r\nmg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing.\r\nUse caution when administering VERSACLOZ to patients with a history of seizures or other\r\npredisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of\r\nmedications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of\r\nseizure associated with VERSACLOZ use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where\r\nsudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an\r\nautomobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing).\r\n\r\n5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy\r\nMyocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be\r\nfatal. Discontinue VERSACLOZ and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis\r\nor cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or\r\ncardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with VERSACLOZ. However, if the benefit of\r\nVERSACLOZ treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or\r\ncardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with VERSACLOZ in consultation with\r\na cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring.\r\nConsider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving VERSACLOZ\r\nwho present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like\r\nsymptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic\r\nfindings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave\r\nprogression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine\r\ntreatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated\r\nmyocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy\r\ncan occur at any period during treatment with VERSACLOZ. It is common for nonspecific flulike symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede\r\nmore overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T,\r\nelevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).\r\nChest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging\r\n(echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left\r\nventricular dysfunction.\r\n\r\n5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\r\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an\r\nincreased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks),\r\nlargely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated\r\npatients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course\r\nof a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%,\r\ncompared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were\r\nvaried, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death)\r\nor infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical\r\nantipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in\r\nthis population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies\r\nmay be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is\r\nnot clear. VERSACLOZ is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related\r\npsychosis [see Boxed Warning].\r\n\r\n5.7 Eosinophilia\r\nEosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/ÂµL, has occurred with\r\nclozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia.\r\nClozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some\r\npatients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis.\r\nSuch organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic\r\nsymptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS).\r\nIf eosinophilia develops during VERSACLOZ treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and\r\nsymptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other\r\norgan-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is\r\nsuspected, discontinue VERSACLOZ immediately.\r\nIf a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen\r\nvascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and\r\ncontinue VERSACLOZ.\r\nClozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can\r\nresolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of\r\nclozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue\r\nVERSACLOZ under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over\r\nseveral weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt VERSACLOZ therapy\r\nand rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical\r\nassessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist.\r\n\r\n5.8 QT Interval Prolongation\r\nQT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac\r\narrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing\r\nVERSACLOZ, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious\r\ncardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac\r\ndeath, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure,\r\ntreatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ, and electrolyte abnormalities.\r\nPrior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ, perform a careful physical examination, medical\r\nhistory, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum\r\nchemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue VERSACLOZ if the QTc\r\ninterval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes\r\nor other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac\r\nevaluation and discontinue VERSACLOZ.\r\nUse caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific\r\nantipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine,\r\ndroperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin,\r\nsparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III\r\nantiarrhythmic (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate,\r\nmethadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus).\r\nVERSACLOZ is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant\r\ntreatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of VERSACLOZ [see\r\nDrug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\r\nHypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can\r\nresult from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk\r\nfor significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements\r\nof serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct\r\nelectrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ.\r\n\r\n5.9 Metabolic Changes\r\nAtypical antipsychotic drugs, including VERSACLOZ, have been associated with metabolic\r\nchanges that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes\r\ninclude hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs\r\nmay produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile.\r\nHyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus\r\nHyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma\r\nor death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including\r\nVERSACLOZ. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose\r\nabnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes\r\nmellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the\r\ngeneral population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use\r\nand hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However,\r\nepidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related\r\nadverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not\r\navailable.\r\nPatients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on VERSACLOZ\r\nshould be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for\r\ndiabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with\r\natypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of\r\ntreatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics\r\nshould be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia,\r\nand weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical\r\nantipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has\r\nresolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required\r\ncontinuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.\r\nIn a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in\r\nfasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and\r\n+4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical\r\nincreases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group\r\n(Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day).\r\nThe maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day).\r\nThe median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine.\r\nTable 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change\r\n(at least once) from\r\nbaseline\r\nTreatment Arm N n (%)\r\nNormal\r\n(<100 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27)\r\nFasting Glucose\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10)\r\nBorderline\r\n(100 to 125 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥126 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 57 24 (42)\r\nChlorpromazine 43 12 (28)\r\nDyslipidemia\r\nUndesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics,\r\nincluding VERSACLOZ. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid\r\nevaluations in patients using VERSACLOZ, is recommended.\r\nIn a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment\r\nwas associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and\r\nHDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group\r\nand 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult\r\nsubjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum\r\ntriglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine\r\ntreatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as\r\nillustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or\r\nfasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine\r\nand chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range\r\nwas 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.\r\nTable 5: Mean Changes in Total Cholesterol and Triglyceride Concentration in Studies in\r\nAdult Subjects with Schizophrenia\r\nTreatment Arm Baseline total cholesterol\r\nconcentration (mg/dL)\r\nChange from baseline\r\nmg/dL (%)\r\nClozapine (N=334) 184 +13 (7)\r\nChlorpromazine (N=185) 182 +15 (8)\r\nBaseline triglyceride\r\nconcentration (mg/dL)\r\nChange from baseline\r\nmg/dL (%)\r\nClozapine (N=6) 130 +71 (54)\r\nChlorpromazine (N=7) 110 +39 (35)\r\nTable 6: Categorical Changes in Lipid Concentrations in Studies in Adult Subjects with\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change (at\r\nleast once) from\r\nBaseline\r\nTreatment\r\nArm N n (%)\r\nTotal\r\nCholesterol\r\n(random or\r\nfasting)\r\nIncrease by â‰¥40 mg/dL\r\nClozapine 334 111 (33)\r\nChlorpromazine 185 46 (25)\r\nNormal (<200 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥240 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 222 18 (8)\r\nChlorpromazine 132 3 (2)\r\nBorderline\r\n(200 - 239 mg/dL) to\r\nHigh (â‰¥240 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 79 30 (38)\r\nChlorpromazine 34 14 (41)\r\nTriglycerides\r\n(fasting)\r\nIncrease by â‰¥50 mg/dL\r\nClozapine 6 3 (50)\r\nChlorpromazine 7 3 (43)\r\nNormal (<150 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥200 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 4 0 (0)\r\nChlorpromazine 6 2 (33)\r\nBorderline\r\n(â‰¥150 mg/dL and Clozapine 1 1 (100)\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change (at\r\nleast once) from\r\nBaseline\r\nTreatment\r\nArm N n (%)\r\n<200 mg/dL) to\r\nHigh (â‰¥200 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 1 0 (0)\r\nWeight Gain\r\nWeight gain has occurred with the use of antipsychotics, including VERSACLOZ.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include\r\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or\r\nblood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can\r\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal\r\nfailure.\r\nThe diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to\r\nconsider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection,\r\nheat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms,\r\nand drug fever).\r\nThe management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs\r\nand other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and\r\nmedical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general\r\nagreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS.\r\nIf a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential\r\nreintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if\r\nrestarting treatment with antipsychotics.\r\nNMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications,\r\nincluding lithium.\r\n\r\n5.11 Fever\r\nDuring clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak\r\nincidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and selflimited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase\r\nor decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia\r\nor infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].\r\n\r\n5.12 Pulmonary Embolism\r\nPulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine.\r\nConsider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep vein\r\nthrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether\r\npulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some\r\ncharacteristic(s) of patients is not clear.\r\n\r\n5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity\r\nVERSACLOZ has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with VERSACLOZ can result in\r\nCNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle\r\nglaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in\r\nwhich anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions.\r\nTreatment with VERSACLOZ can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including\r\nconstipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be\r\nfatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary\r\ntherapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more\r\nserious cases.\r\n\r\n5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance\r\nVERSACLOZ can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution\r\npatients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably\r\ncertain that VERSACLOZ does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related.\r\nConsider reducing the dose if they occur.\r\n\r\n5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia\r\nTardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including\r\nVERSACLOZ. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic\r\nmovements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to\r\nincrease with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the\r\nsyndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe\r\nVERSACLOZ in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the\r\nlowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically\r\nassess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs.\r\nHowever, some patients may require treatment with VERSACLOZ despite the presence of the\r\nsyndrome.\r\nThere is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely\r\nif treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress)\r\nthe signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of\r\nsymptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown.\r\n\r\n5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions\r\nIn controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical\r\nantipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions\r\n(e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased\r\nrisk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for VERSACLOZ or other\r\nantipsychotics or other patient populations. VERSACLOZ should be used with caution in\r\npatients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.\r\n\r\n5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of\r\nVERSACLOZ\r\nIf abrupt discontinuation of VERSACLOZ is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or\r\nanother medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse\r\nreactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting,\r\nand diarrhea.

                            "Value": "7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect VERSACLOZ\r\nClozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4,\r\nand CYP2D6. Use caution when administering VERSACLOZ concomitantly with drugs that are\r\ninducers or inhibitors of these enzymes.\r\nCYP1A2 Inhibitors\r\nConcomitant use of VERSACLOZ and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of\r\nclozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the VERSACLOZ dose to one third\r\nof the original dose when VERSACLOZ is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g.,\r\nfluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The VERSACLOZ dose should be increased to the\r\noriginal dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage\r\nand Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\r\nModerate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients\r\nclosely when VERSACLOZ is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the\r\nVERSACLOZ dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nCYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors\r\nConcomitant treatment with VERSACLOZ and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g.,\r\ncimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine,\r\nterbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical\r\nPharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors.\r\nConsider reducing the VERSACLOZ dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nCYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers\r\nConcomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma\r\nconcentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of VERSACLOZ. Tobacco\r\nsmoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine,\r\nphenytoin, St. Johnâ€™s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the VERSACLOZ dose\r\nif used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of\r\nVERSACLOZ and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and\r\nAdministration (2.7)].\r\nConsider reducing the VERSACLOZ dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme\r\ninducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and\r\nan increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nDrugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation\r\nUse caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific\r\nantipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin,\r\nsparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III\r\nantiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate,\r\nmethadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see\r\nWarnings and Precautions (5.8)].\r\n\r\n7.2 Potential for VERSACLOZ to Affect Other Drugs\r\nConcomitant use of VERSACLOZ with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels\r\nof these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering VERSACLOZ with other drugs\r\nthat are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than\r\nusually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine,\r\nand Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide). "

The studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due\r\nto clozapine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response,\r\nVERSACLOZ should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\r\nClinical Considerations\r\nConsider the risk of exacerbation of psychosis when discontinuing or changing treatment with\r\nantipsychotic medications during pregnancy and postpartum. Consider early screening for\r\ngestational diabetes for patients treated with antipsychotic medications [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.9)]. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of\r\npregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery.\r\nMonitor neonates for symptoms of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence,\r\nrespiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The severity of complications can vary from selflimited symptoms to some neonates requiring intensive care unit support and prolonged\r\nhospitalization.\r\nAnimal Data\r\nIn embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter\r\nsizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period\r\nof organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a\r\nmg/m2 body surface area basis. \r\nIn peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over\r\nthe last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at\r\nbirth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and\r\nmated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or\r\nbody weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day\r\non a mg/m2 body surface area basis.\r\n\r\n8.3 Nursing Mothers\r\nVERSACLOZ is present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in\r\nnursing infants from VERSACLOZ, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing\r\nor to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\n\r\n8.4 Pediatric Use\r\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n\r\n8.5 Geriatric Use\r\nThere have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing\r\nVERSACLOZ to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in\r\ntheir response to VERSACLOZ.\r\nOrthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning\r\nand Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised\r\ncardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects.\r\nElderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such\r\nas urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].\r\nCarefully select VERSACLOZ doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater\r\nfrequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease\r\nand other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia\r\nappears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.15)].\r\n\r\n8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment\r\nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic\r\nfunction. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is\r\nalmost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Clinical\r\nPharmacology (12.3)].\r\n\r\n8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers\r\nDose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine\r\nconcentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Clinical Pharmacology\r\n(12.3)].\r\n\r\n8.8 Hospice Patients\r\nFor hospice patients (i.e., terminally ill patients with an estimated life expectancy of 6 months or\r\nless), the prescriber may reduce the ANC monitoring frequency to once every 6 months, after a\r\ndiscussion with the patient and his/her caregiver. Individual treatment decisions should weigh the\r\nimportance of monitoring ANC in the context of the need to control psychiatric symptoms and\r\nthe patientâ€™s terminal illness. "

A manic episode is a distinct\r\nperiod of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Typical symptoms of\r\nmania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas,\r\ngrandiosity, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possible hostility. A mixed episode is characterized\r\nby the criteria for a manic episode in conjunction with those for a major depressive episode\r\n(depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities).\r\nThe efficacy of Depakote ER is based in part on studies of Depakote (divalproex sodium delayed\r\nrelease tablets) in this indication, and was confirmed in a 3-week trial with patients meeting DSM-IV\r\nTR criteria for bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed type, who were hospitalized for acute mania [see\r\nClinical Studies (14.1)].\r\nThe effectiveness of valproate for long-term use in mania, i.e., more than 3 weeks, has not been\r\ndemonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, healthcare providers who elect to use Depakote\r\nER for extended periods should continually reevaluate the long-term risk-benefits of the drug for the\r\nindividual patient.\r\n1.2 Epilepsy\r\nDepakote ER is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult patients\r\nand pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years with complex partial seizures that occur either in\r\nisolation or in association with other types of seizures. Depakote ER is also indicated for use as sole\r\nand adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures in adults and\r\nchildren 10 years of age or older, and adjunctively in adults and children 10 years of age or older with\r\nmultiple seizure types that include absence seizures.\r\nSimple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness\r\naccompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs.\r\nComplex absence is the term used when other signs are also present.\r\n1.3 Migraine\r\nDepakote ER is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches. There is no evidence that Depakote\r\nER is useful in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. Because it may be a hazard to the fetus,\r\nDepakote ER should be considered for women of childbearing potential only after this risk has been\r\nthoroughly discussed with the patient and weighed against the potential benefits of treatment [see\r\nWarnings and Precautions (5.2), Patient Counseling Information (17.3)]."

                            "Title": "Dosage and administration",
                            "Value": "Depakote ER is an extended-release product intended for once-a-day oral administration. Depakote\r\nER tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be crushed or chewed.\r\n2.1 Mania\r\nDepakote ER tablets are administered orally. The recommended initial dose is 25 mg/kg/day given\r\nonce daily. The dose should be increased as rapidly as possible to achieve the lowest therapeutic\r\ndose which produces the desired clinical effect or the desired range of plasma concentrations. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of acute mania or mixed type, patients were dosed to a clinical\r\nresponse with a trough plasma concentration between 85 and 125 mcg/mL. The maximum\r\nrecommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day.\r\nThere is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to guide a clinician in the longer term\r\nmanagement of a patient who improves during Depakote ER treatment of an acute manic episode.\r\nWhile it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is\r\ndesirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes,\r\nthere are no data to support the benefits of Depakote ER in such longer-term treatment (i.e., beyond\r\n3 weeks).\r\n2.2 Epilepsy\r\nDepakote ER (divalproex sodium) extended release tablets are administered orally, and must be\r\nswallowed whole. As Depakote ER dosage is titrated upward, concentrations of clonazepam,\r\ndiazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, tolbutamide, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and/or phenytoin\r\nmay be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\r\nComplex Partial Seizures\r\nFor adults and children 10 years of age or older.\r\nMonotherapy (Initial Therapy)\r\nDepakote ER has not been systematically studied as initial therapy. Patients should initiate therapy at\r\n10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal\r\nclinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day.\r\nIf satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to\r\ndetermine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No\r\nrecommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be\r\nmade.\r\nThe probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma\r\nconcentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males. The benefit of improved\r\nseizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of\r\nadverse reactions.\r\nConversion to Monotherapy\r\nPatients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10\r\nmg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at\r\ndaily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma\r\nlevels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic\r\nrange (50 - 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses\r\nabove 60 mg/kg/day can be made.\r\nConcomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every\r\n2 weeks. This reduction may be started at initiation of Depakote ER therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2\r\nweeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction. The speed and duration\r\nof withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored\r\nclosely during this period for increased seizure frequency.\r\nAdjunctive Therapy\r\nDepakote ER may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage\r\nmay be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Ordinarily, optimal\r\nclinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has\r\nnot been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the\r\nusually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL). No recommendation regarding the safety of\r\nvalproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.\r\nIn a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either\r\ncarbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin\r\ndosage was needed [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. However, since valproate may interact with these or\r\nother concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration\r\ndeterminations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug\r\nInteractions (7)].\r\nSimple and Complex Absence Seizures\r\nThe recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10\r\nmg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases. The maximum\r\nrecommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day.\r\nA good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and\r\ntherapeutic effect. However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with\r\nabsence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL. Some patients may be controlled\r\nwith lower or higher serum concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\r\nAs Depakote ER dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin\r\nmay be affected [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\r\nAntiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered\r\nto prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with\r\nattendant hypoxia and threat to life.\r\n2.3 Migraine\r\nDepakote ER is indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults.\r\nThe recommended starting dose is 500 mg once daily for 1 week, thereafter increasing to 1000 mg\r\nonce daily. Although doses other than 1000 mg once daily of Depakote ER have not been evaluated\r\nin patients with migraine, the effective dose range of Depakote (divalproex sodium delayed-release\r\ntablets) in these patients is 500-1000 mg/day. As with other valproate products, doses of Depakote\r\nER should be individualized and dose adjustment may be necessary. If a patient requires smaller\r\ndose adjustments than that available with Depakote ER, Depakote should be used instead.\r\n2.4 Conversion from Depakote to Depakote ER\r\nIn adult patients and pediatric patients 10 years of age or older with epilepsy previously receiving\r\nDepakote, Depakote ER should be administered once-daily using a dose 8 to 20% higher than the\r\ntotal daily dose of Depakote (Table 1). For patients whose Depakote total daily dose cannot be\r\ndirectly converted to Depakote ER, consideration may be given at the clinicianâ€™s discretion to increase\r\nthe patientâ€™s Depakote total daily dose to the next higher dosage before converting to the appropriate\r\ntotal daily dose of Depakote ER.\r\nTable 1. Dose Conversion\r\nDepakote Depakote ER\r\nTotal Daily Dose (mg) (mg)\r\n500* - 625 750\r\n750* - 875 1000\r\n1000*-1125 1250\r\n1250-1375 1500\r\n1500-1625 1750\r\n1750 2000\r\n1875-2000 2250\r\n2125-2250 2500\r\n2375 2750\r\n2500-2750 3000\r\n2875 3250\r\n3000-3125 3500\r\n* These total daily doses of Depakote cannot be directly converted to an 8 to 20% higher total daily dose of\r\nDepakote ER because the required dosing strengths of Depakote ER are not available. Consideration may be\r\ngiven at the clinician's discretion to increase the patient's Depakote total daily dose to the next higher dosage\r\nbefore converting to the appropriate total daily dose of Depakote ER.\r\nThere is insufficient data to allow a conversion factor recommendation for patients with DEPAKOTE\r\ndoses above 3125 mg/day. Plasma valproate Cmin concentrations for DEPAKOTE ER on average are\r\nequivalent to DEPAKOTE, but may vary across patients after conversion. If satisfactory clinical\r\nresponse has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not\r\nthey are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL) [see Clinical Pharmacology\r\n(12.2)].\r\n2.5 General Dosing Advice\r\nDosing in Elderly Patients\r\nDue to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to\r\nsomnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients. Starting doses in\r\nthe elderly lower than 250mg can only be achieved by the use of Depakote. Dosage should be\r\nincreased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration,\r\nsomnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be\r\nconsidered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence.\r\nThe ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical\r\nresponse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].\r\nDose-Related Adverse Reactions\r\nThe frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be\r\ndose-related. The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate\r\nconcentrations of â‰¥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or â‰¥ 135 mcg/mL (males) [see Warnings and Precautions\r\n(5.7)]. The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the\r\npossibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.\r\nG.I. Irritation\r\nPatients who experience G.I. irritation may benefit from administration of the drug with food or by\r\nslowly building up the dose from an initial low level.\r\nCompliance\r\nPatients should be informed to take Depakote ER every day as prescribed. If a dose is missed it\r\nshould be taken as soon as possible, unless it is almost time for the next dose. If a dose is skipped,\r\nthe patient should not double the next dose."

                            "Value": "5.1 Hepatotoxicity\r\nHepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents\r\nusually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be\r\npreceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia,\r\nand vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be\r\nmonitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Liver function tests should be performed prior\r\nto therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months. However,\r\nhealthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be\r\nabnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and\r\nphysical examination.\r\nCaution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of\r\nhepatic disease. Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic\r\ndisorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with\r\norganic brain disease may be at particular risk. Experience has indicated that children under the age\r\nof two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those\r\nwith the aforementioned conditions. When Depakote ER is used in this patient group, it should be\r\nused with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against\r\nthe risks. Above this age group, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal\r\nhepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.\r\nThe drug should be discontinued immediately in the presence of significant hepatic dysfunction,\r\nsuspected or apparent. In some cases, hepatic dysfunction has progressed in spite of discontinuation\r\nof drug [see Boxed Warning and Contraindications (4)].\r\n5.2 Use in Women of Childbearing Potential\r\nBecause of the risk to the fetus of neural tube defects and other major congenital malformations,\r\nwhich may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of\r\nchildbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition. This is\r\nespecially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with\r\npermanent injury or death (e.g., migraine). Women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Women who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled regarding the relative risks\r\nand benefits of valproate use during pregnancy, and alternative therapeutic options should be\r\nconsidered for these patients. [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\r\nTo prevent major seizures, Depakote ER should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate\r\nstatus epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.\r\nEvidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of\r\npregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population.\r\n5.3 Birth Defects and Neurobehavioral Adverse Effects\r\nValproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy registry data\r\nshow that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities\r\n(e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and malformations involving various body\r\nsystems). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is\r\nabout four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure\r\nmonotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the\r\nfirst trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general\r\npopulation.\r\nSeveral published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero\r\nhave lower cognitive test scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or\r\nto no antiepileptic drugs in utero. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study\r\nconducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to\r\nvalproate had lower Differential Ability Scale (D.A.S.) scores at age 3 (92 [95% C.I. 88-97]) than\r\nchildren with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated:\r\nlamotrigine (101 [95% C.I. 98-104]), carbamazepine (98 [95% C.I. 95-102]) and phenytoin (99 [95%\r\nC.I. 94 -104]). The D.A.S., which has a mean score of 100 (SD = 15), is a battery of cognitive tests\r\ndesigned for children ages 2.5 to 17 years. The D.A.S. is a measure of neurobehavioral development\r\nperformed when children are too young to undergo IQ testing and generally correlates with IQ scores\r\nlater in childhood.\r\nAlthough all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence\r\nsupports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero causes subsequent adverse effects on\r\ncognitive development.\r\nIn animal studies, valproate-exposed offspring had malformations similar to those seen in humans\r\nand demonstrated behavioral deficits. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]\r\n5.4 Pancreatitis\r\nCases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving\r\nvalproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with rapid progression from initial\r\nsymptoms to death. Some cases have occurred shortly after initial use as well as after several years\r\nof use. The rate based upon the reported cases exceeds that expected in the general population and\r\nthere have been cases in which pancreatitis recurred after rechallenge with valproate. In clinical trials,\r\nthere were 2 cases of pancreatitis without alternative etiology in 2416 patients, representing 1044\r\npatient-years experience. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea,\r\nvomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If\r\npancreatitis is diagnosed, Depakote ER should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for\r\nthe underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated [see Boxed Warning].\r\n5.5 Urea Cycle Disorders\r\nDepakote ER is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD).\r\nHyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of\r\nvalproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities,\r\nparticularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Prior to the initiation of Depakote ER therapy,\r\nevaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1) those with a history of\r\nunexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancyrelated or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma\r\nammonia or glutamine; 2) those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability,\r\nataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3) those with a family history of UCD or a family history of\r\nunexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD.\r\nPatients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving\r\nvalproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.9)].\r\n5.6 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation\r\nAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Depakote ER, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior\r\nin patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication\r\nshould be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior,\r\nand/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.\r\nPooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11\r\ndifferent AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk\r\n(adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients\r\nrandomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the\r\nestimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was\r\n0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of\r\napproximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were\r\nfour suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the\r\nnumber is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.\r\nThe increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week\r\nafter starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed.\r\nBecause most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal\r\nthoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.\r\nThe risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed.\r\nThe finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of\r\nindications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary\r\nsubstantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.\r\nTable 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.\r\nTable 2. Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis\r\nIndication Placebo Patients\r\nwith Events Per\r\n1000 Patients\r\nDrug Patients with\r\nEvents Per 1000\r\nPatients\r\nRelative Risk:\r\nIncidence of\r\nEvents in Drug\r\nPatients/Incidence\r\nRisk Difference:\r\nAdditional Drug\r\nPatients with\r\nEvents Per 1000\r\nin Placebo\r\nPatients\r\nPatients\r\nEpilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4\r\nPsychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9\r\nOther 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9\r\nTotal 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9\r\nThe relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in\r\nclinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the\r\nepilepsy and psychiatric indications.\r\nAnyone considering prescribing Depakote ER or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal\r\nthoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which\r\nAEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of\r\nsuicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the\r\nprescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be\r\nrelated to the illness being treated.\r\nPatients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal\r\nthoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening\r\nof the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the\r\nemergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should\r\nbe reported immediately to healthcare providers.\r\n5.7 Thrombocytopenia\r\nThe frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be\r\ndose-related. In a clinical trial of valproate as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients\r\n(27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets â‰¤ 75 x\r\n109/L. Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts\r\nto normal. In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment. In this\r\nstudy, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate\r\nconcentrations of â‰¥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or â‰¥ 135 mcg/mL (males). The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater\r\nincidence of adverse effects.\r\nBecause of reports of thrombocytopenia, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation,\r\nand abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen), platelet counts and coagulation tests are\r\nrecommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients\r\nreceiving Depakote ER be monitored for platelet count and coagulation parameters prior to planned\r\nsurgery. Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication\r\nfor reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.\r\n5.8 Hyperammonemia\r\nHyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present\r\ndespite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or\r\nchanges in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia\r\nlevel should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with\r\nhypothermia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy\r\nshould be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be\r\ninitiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders [see\r\nContraindications and Warnings and Precautions (4, 5.5, 5.8, 5.9)].\r\nDuring the placebo controlled pediatric mania trial, one (1) in twenty (20) adolescents (5%) treated\r\nwith valproate developed increased plasma ammonia levels compared to no (0) patients treated with\r\nplacebo.\r\nAsymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring\r\nof plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be\r\nconsidered.\r\n5.9 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy associated with Concomitant Topiramate Use\r\nConcomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia\r\nwith or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. Clinical symptoms of\r\nhyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or\r\ncognitive function with lethargy or vomiting. Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. In most cases, symptoms and signs\r\nabated with discontinuation of either drug. This adverse event is not due to a pharmacokinetic\r\ninteraction. It is not known if topiramate monotherapy is associated with hyperammonemia. Patients\r\nwith inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk\r\nfor hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, an interaction of\r\ntopiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible\r\npersons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status,\r\nhyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured\r\n[see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].\r\n5.10 Hypothermia\r\nHypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to < 35Â° C (95Â° F), has been\r\nreported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of\r\nhyperammonemia. This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate\r\nwith valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate [see\r\nDrug Interactions (7.3)]. Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop\r\nhypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy,\r\nconfusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular\r\nand respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood\r\nammonia levels.\r\n5.11 Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity Reactions\r\nMulti-organ hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported in close temporal association to the\r\ninitiation of valproate therapy in adult and pediatric patients (median time to detection 21 days: range\r\n1 to 40 days). Although there have been a limited number of reports, many of these cases resulted in\r\nhospitalization and at least one death has been reported. Signs and symptoms of this disorder were\r\ndiverse; however, patients typically, although not exclusively, presented with fever and rash\r\nassociated with other organ system involvement. Other associated manifestations may include\r\nlymphadenopathy, hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, hematological abnormalities (e.g.,\r\neosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia), pruritus, nephritis, oliguria, hepato-renal syndrome,\r\narthralgia, and asthenia. Because the disorder is variable in its expression, other organ system\r\nsymptoms and signs, not noted here, may occur. If this reaction is suspected, valproate should be discontinued and an alternative treatment started. Although the existence of cross sensitivity with\r\nother drugs that produce this syndrome is unclear, the experience amongst drugs associated with\r\nmulti-organ hypersensitivity would indicate this to be a possibility.\r\n5.12 Interaction with Carbapenem Antibiotics\r\nCarbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list)\r\nmay reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure\r\ncontrol. Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem\r\ntherapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate\r\nconcentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\r\n5.13 Somnolence in the Elderly\r\nIn a double-blind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age = 83\r\nyears), doses were increased by 125 mg/day to a target dose of 20 mg/kg/day. A significantly higher\r\nproportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically\r\nsignificant, there was a higher proportion of patients with dehydration. Discontinuations for\r\nsomnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo. In some patients with somnolence\r\n(approximately one-half), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss. There was\r\na trend for the patients who experienced these events to have a lower baseline albumin\r\nconcentration, lower valproate clearance, and a higher BUN. In elderly patients, dosage should be\r\nincreased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration,\r\nsomnolence, and other adverse reactions. Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be\r\nconsidered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence\r\n[see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\r\n5.14 Monitoring: Drug Plasma Concentration\r\nSince valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme\r\ninduction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are\r\nrecommended during the early course of therapy [see Drug Interactions (7)].\r\n5.15 Effect on Ketone and Thyroid Function Tests\r\nValproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a keto-metabolite which may lead to a false\r\ninterpretation of the urine ketone test.\r\nThere have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate. The clinical\r\nsignificance of these is unknown.\r\n5.16 Effect on HIV and CMV Viruses Replication\r\nThere are in vitro studies that suggest valproate stimulates the replication of the HIV and CMV\r\nviruses under certain experimental conditions. The clinical consequence, if any, is not known.\r\nAdditionally, the relevance of these in vitro findings is uncertain for patients receiving maximally\r\nsuppressive antiretroviral therapy. Nevertheless, these data should be borne in mind when\r\ninterpreting the results from regular monitoring of the viral load in HIV infected patients receiving\r\nvalproate or when following CMV infected patients clinically."

Since patients were also treated\r\nwith other antiepilepsy drugs, it is not possible, in most cases, to determine whether the following\r\nadverse reactions can be ascribed to Depakote alone, or the combination of Depakote and other\r\nantiepilepsy drugs.\r\nTable 4.

These effects are usually transient and rarely require discontinuation of therapy.\r\nDiarrhea, abdominal cramps, and constipation have been reported. Both anorexia with some weight\r\nloss and increased appetite with weight gain have also been reported. In some patients, many of\r\nwhom have functional or anatomic (including ileostomy or colostomy) gastrointestinal disorders with\r\nshortened GI transit times, there have been postmarketing reports of Depakote ER tablets in stool.\r\nCNS Effects\r\nSedative effects have occurred in patients receiving valproate alone but occur most often in patients\r\nreceiving combination therapy. Sedation usually abates upon reduction of other antiepileptic\r\nmedication. Tremor (may be dose-related), hallucinations, ataxia, headache, nystagmus, diplopia,\r\nasterixis, \"spots before eyes\", dysarthria, dizziness, confusion, hypesthesia, vertigo, incoordination,\r\nand parkinsonism have been reported with the use of valproate. Rare cases of coma have occurred\r\nin patients receiving valproate alone or in conjunction with phenobarbital. In rare instances\r\nencephalopathy with or without fever has developed shortly after the introduction of valproate\r\nmonotherapy without evidence of hepatic dysfunction or inappropriately high plasma valproate levels.\r\nAlthough recovery has been described following drug withdrawal, there have been fatalities in\r\npatients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy, particularly in patients with underlying urea cycle\r\ndisorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].\r\nSeveral reports have noted reversible cerebral atrophy and dementia in association with valproate\r\ntherapy.\r\nDermatologic\r\nTransient hair loss, skin rash, photosensitivity, generalized pruritus, erythema multiforme, and\r\nStevens-Johnson syndrome. Rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported including a\r\nfatal case in a 6 month old infant taking valproate and several other concomitant medications. An\r\nadditional case of toxic epidermal necrosis resulting in death was reported in a 35 year old patient with AIDS taking several concomitant medications and with a history of multiple cutaneous drug\r\nreactions. Serious skin reactions have been reported with concomitant administration of lamotrigine\r\nand valproate [see Drug Interactions (7)].\r\nPsychiatric\r\nEmotional upset, depression, psychosis, aggression, hyperactivity, hostility, and behavioral\r\ndeterioration.\r\nMusculoskeletal\r\nWeakness.\r\nHematologic\r\nThrombocytopenia and inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation may be reflected in\r\naltered bleeding time, petechiae, bruising, hematoma formation, epistaxis, and frank hemorrhage [see\r\nWarnings and Precautions (5.7) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Relative lymphocytosis, macrocytosis,\r\nhypofibrinogenemia, leukopenia, eosinophilia, anemia including macrocytic with or without folate\r\ndeficiency, bone marrow suppression, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and acute\r\nintermittent porphyria.\r\nHepatic\r\nMinor elevations of transaminases (e.g., SGOT and SGPT) and LDH are frequent and appear to be\r\ndose-related. Occasionally, laboratory test results include increases in serum bilirubin and abnormal\r\nchanges in other liver function tests. These results may reflect potentially serious hepatotoxicity [see\r\nWarnings and Precautions (5.1)].\r\nEndocrine\r\nIrregular menses, secondary amenorrhea, breast enlargement, galactorrhea, and parotid gland\r\nswelling. Abnormal thyroid function tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].\r\nThere have been rare spontaneous reports of polycystic ovary disease.

                            "Value": "7.1 Effects of Co-Administered Drugs on Valproate Clearance\r\nDrugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of\r\nglucuronosyltransferases, may increase the clearance of valproate. For example, phenytoin,\r\ncarbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate. Thus,\r\npatients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients\r\nreceiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.\r\nIn contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be\r\nexpected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated\r\noxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and betaoxidation.\r\nBecause of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug\r\nconcentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn.\r\nThe following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly\r\nprescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics. The list is not exhaustive nor could it be,\r\nsince new interactions are continuously being reported.\r\nDrugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed\r\nAspirin\r\nA study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate\r\nto pediatric patients (n=6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of\r\nvalproate. Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to\r\nvalproate alone. The Î²-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-\r\nketo valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3%\r\nin the presence of aspirin. Whether or not the interaction observed in this study applies to adults is\r\nunknown, but caution should be observed if valproate and aspirin are to be co-administered.\r\nCarbapenem antibiotics\r\nA clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients\r\nreceiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a\r\ncomplete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction in not well\r\nunderstood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating\r\ncarbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if\r\nserum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates [see Warnings\r\nand Precautions (5.12)].\r\nFelbamate\r\nA study involving the co-administration of 1200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with\r\nepilepsy (n=10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115\r\nmcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2400 mg/day increased the\r\nmean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate\r\ndosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.\r\nRifampin\r\nA study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of\r\ndaily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.\r\nValproate dosage adjustment may be necessary when it is co-administered with rifampin.\r\nDrugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed\r\nAntacids\r\nA study involving the co-administration of valproate 500 mg with commonly administered antacids\r\n(Maalox, Trisogel, and Titralac - 160 mEq doses) did not reveal any effect on the extent of absorption\r\nof valproate.\r\nChlorpromazine\r\nA study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients\r\nalready receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15% increase in trough plasma levels of\r\nvalproate.\r\nHaloperidol\r\nA study involving the administration of 6 to 10 mg/day of haloperidol to schizophrenic patients already\r\nreceiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed no significant changes in valproate trough plasma levels.\r\nCimetidine and Ranitidine\r\nCimetidine and ranitidine do not affect the clearance of valproate.\r\n7.2 Effects of Valproate on Other Drugs\r\nValproate has been found to be a weak inhibitor of some P450 isozymes, epoxide hydrase, and\r\nglucuronosyltransferases. \r\nThe following list provides information about the potential for an influence of valproate coadministration on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of several commonly prescribed\r\nmedications. The list is not exhaustive, since new interactions are continuously being reported.\r\nDrugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed\r\nAmitriptyline/Nortriptyline\r\nAdministration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5\r\nfemales) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of\r\namitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline. Rare postmarketing reports of\r\nconcurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been\r\nreceived. Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity.\r\nMonitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly\r\nwith amitriptyline. Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in\r\nthe presence of valproate.\r\nCarbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide\r\nSerum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide\r\n(CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.\r\nClonazepam\r\nThe concomitant use of valproate and clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a\r\nhistory of absence type seizures.\r\nDiazepam\r\nValproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism. Coadministration of valproate (1500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in\r\nhealthy volunteers (n=6). Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were\r\nreduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate. The elimination half-life of\r\ndiazepam remained unchanged upon addition of valproate.\r\nEthosuximide\r\nValproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide. Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of\r\n500 mg with valproate (800 to 1600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n=6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as\r\ncompared to ethosuximide alone. Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along\r\nwith other anticonvulsants, should be monitored for alterations in serum concentrations of both drugs.\r\nLamotrigine\r\nIn a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine\r\nincreased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase). The dose of\r\nlamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate. Serious skin reactions (such as\r\nStevens - Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported with concomitant\r\nlamotrigine and valproate administration. See lamotrigine package insert for details on lamotrigine\r\ndosing with concomitant valproate administration.\r\nPhenobarbital\r\nValproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital. Co-administration of valproate (250\r\nmg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n=6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life\r\nand a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose). The fraction of\r\nphenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.\r\nThere is evidence for severe CNS depression, with or without significant elevations of barbiturate or\r\nvalproate serum concentrations. All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be\r\nclosely monitored for neurological toxicity. Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if\r\npossible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.\r\nPrimidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction with\r\nvalproate.\r\nPhenytoin\r\nValproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic\r\nmetabolism. Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal\r\nvolunteers (n=7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin. Total plasma\r\nclearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of\r\nvalproate. Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.\r\nIn patients with epilepsy, there have been reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with the\r\ncombination of valproate and phenytoin. The dosage of phenytoin should be adjusted as required by\r\nthe clinical situation.\r\nTolbutamide\r\nFrom in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when\r\nadded to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate. The clinical relevance of this\r\ndisplacement is unknown.\r\nWarfarin\r\nIn an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%. The\r\ntherapeutic relevance of this is unknown; however, coagulation tests should be monitored if valproate\r\ntherapy is instituted in patients taking anticoagulants.\r\nZidovudine\r\nIn six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was\r\ndecreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine\r\nwas unaffected.\r\nDrugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed\r\nAcetaminophen\r\nValproate had no effect on any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of acetaminophen when it was\r\nconcurrently administered to three epileptic patients.\r\nClozapine\r\nIn psychotic patients (n=11), no interaction was observed when valproate was co-administered with\r\nclozapine.\r\nLithium\r\nCo-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lithium carbonate (300 mg TID) to normal male\r\nvolunteers (n=16) had no effect on the steady-state kinetics of lithium.\r\nLorazepam\r\nConcomitant administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and lorazepam (1 mg BID) in normal male\r\nvolunteers (n=9) was accompanied by a 17% decrease in the plasma clearance of lorazepam.\r\nOral Contraceptive Steroids\r\nAdministration of a single-dose of ethinyloestradiol (50 mcg)/levonorgestrel (250 mcg) to 6 women on\r\nvalproate (200 mg BID) therapy for 2 months did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interaction.\r\n7.3 Topiramate\r\nConcomitant administration of valproate and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia\r\nwith and without encephalopathy [see Contraindications and Warnings and Precautions (4, 5.8, 5.9)].\r\nConcomitant administration of topiramate with valproate has also been associated with hypothermia\r\nin patients who have tolerated either drug alone. It may be prudent to examine blood ammonia levels\r\nin patients in whom the onset of hypothermia has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.10)]."

                            "Value": "8.1 Pregnancy\r\nTeratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\r\nPregnancy Registry\r\nTo collect information on the effects of in utero exposure to Depakote, physicians should encourage\r\npregnant patients taking Depakote ER to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED)\r\nPregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling toll free 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by the\r\npatients themselves. Information on the registry can be found at the website,\r\nhttp://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/.\r\nFetal Risk Summary\r\nAll pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects (about 3%), pregnancy loss (about 15%), or\r\nother adverse outcomes regardless of drug exposure. Maternal valproate use during pregnancy for\r\nany indication increases the risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, but also\r\nmalformations involving other body systems (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations).\r\nThe risk of major structural abnormalities is greatest during the first trimester; however, other serious developmental effects can occur with valproate use throughout pregnancy. The rate of congenital\r\nmalformations among babies born to epileptic mothers who used valproate during pregnancy has\r\nbeen shown to be about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers who\r\nused other anti-seizure monotherapies.\r\nSeveral published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero\r\nhave lower cognitive test scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or\r\nto no antiepileptic drugs in utero. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\r\nIn animal studies, offspring had structural malformations similar to those seen in humans and\r\ndemonstrated behavioral deficits.\r\nClinical Considerations\r\nâ€¢ Neural tube defects are the congenital malformation most strongly associated with maternal\r\nvalproate use. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure is generally\r\nestimated as 1-2%, compared to an estimated general population risk for spina bifida of about\r\n0.06 to 0.07% (6 to 7 in 10,000 births).\r\nâ€¢ To prevent major seizures, women with epilepsy should not discontinue Depakote ER abruptly,\r\nas this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to\r\nlife. Even minor seizures may pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus. However,\r\ndiscontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy in individual\r\ncases if the seizure disorder severity and frequency do not pose a serious threat to the patient.\r\nâ€¢ Available prenatal diagnostic testing to detect neural tube and other defects should be offered\r\nto pregnant women using valproate.\r\nâ€¢ Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first\r\ntrimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general\r\npopulation. It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects in the offspring of women\r\nreceiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation. Dietary folic acid supplementation\r\nboth prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients\r\nusing valproate.\r\nâ€¢ Patients taking valproate may develop clotting abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions\r\n(5.6)]. A patient who had low fibrinogen when taking multiple anticonvulsants including valproate gave birth to an infant with afibrinogenemia who subsequently died of hemorrhage. If\r\nvalproate is used in pregnancy, the clotting parameters should be monitored carefully.\r\nâ€¢ Patients taking valproate may develop hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1),\r\nBoxed Warning]. Fatal cases of hepatic failure in infants exposed to valproate in utero have\r\nalso been reported following maternal use of valproate during pregnancy.\r\nData\r\nHuman\r\nThere is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that exposure to valproate in utero increases\r\nthe risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities. Based on published data from the\r\nCDCâ€™s National Birth Defects Prevention Network, the risk of spina bifida in the general population is\r\nabout 0.06 to 0.07%. The risk of spina bifida following in utero valproate exposure has been\r\nestimated to be approximately 1 to 2%.\r\nIn one study using NAAED Pregnancy Registry data, 16 cases of major malformations following\r\nprenatal valproate exposure were reported among offspring of 149 enrolled women who used\r\nvalproate during pregnancy. Three of the 16 cases were neural tube defects; the remaining cases\r\nincluded craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and malformations of varying severity\r\ninvolving other body systems. The NAAED Pregnancy Registry has reported a major malformation\r\nrate of 10.7% (95% C.I. 6.3% â€“ 16.9%) in the offspring of women exposed to an average of 1,000\r\nmg/day of valproate monotherapy during pregnancy (dose range 500 â€“ 2000 mg/day). The major\r\nmalformation rate among the internal comparison group of 1,048 epileptic women who received any\r\nother antiepileptic drug monotherapy during pregnancy was 2.9% (95% CI 2.0% to 4.1%). These data\r\nshow a four-fold increased risk for any major malformation (Odds Ratio 4.0; 95% CI 2.1 to 7.4)\r\nfollowing valproate exposure in utero compared to the risk following exposure in utero to any other\r\nantiepileptic drug monotherapy.\r\nSeveral published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero\r\nhave lower cognitive test scores than children exposed to either another antiepileptic drug in utero or\r\nto no antiepileptic drugs in utero. The largest of these studies is a prospective cohort study\r\nconducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to\r\nvalproate had lower Differential Ability Scale (D.A.S.) scores at age 3 (92 [95% C.I. 88-97]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other anti-epileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated:\r\nlamotrigine (101 [95% C.I. 98-104]), carbamazepine (98 [95% C.I. 95-102]) and phenytoin (99 [95%\r\nC.I. 94-104)]. The D.A.S., which has a mean score of 100 (SD = 15), is a battery of cognitive tests\r\ndesigned for children ages 2.5 to 17 years. The D.A.S. is a measure of neurobehavioral development\r\nperformed when children are too young to undergo IQ testing and generally correlates with IQ scores\r\nlater in childhood.\r\nAlthough all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence\r\nsupports a causal association between valproate exposure in utero and subsequent adverse effects\r\non cognitive development.\r\nThere are published case reports of fatal hepatic failure in offspring of women who used valproate\r\nduring pregnancy.\r\nAnimal\r\nIn developmental toxicity studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys, increased rates of\r\nfetal structural abnormalities, intrauterine growth retardation, and embryo-fetal death occurred\r\nfollowing treatment of pregnant animals with valproate during organogenesis at clinically relevant\r\ndoses (calculated on a body surface area basis). Valproate induced malformations of multiple organ\r\nsystems, including skeletal, cardiac, and urogenital defects. In mice, in addition to other\r\nmalformations, fetal neural tube defects have been reported following valproate administration during\r\ncritical periods of organogenesis, and the teratogenic response correlated with peak maternal drug\r\nlevels. Behavioral abnormalities (including cognitive, locomotor, and social interaction deficits) and\r\nbrain histopathological changes have also been reported in mice and rat offspring exposed prenatally\r\nto clinically relevant doses of valproate.\r\n8.3 Nursing Mothers\r\nValproate is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when valproate is administered to\r\na nursing woman.\r\n8.4 Pediatric Use\r\nExperience has indicated that pediatric patients under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk\r\nof developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions [see Boxed Warning Warning and Precautions (5.1)]. When valproate is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme\r\ncaution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. Above the age of 2\r\nyears, experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in\r\nprogressively older patient groups.\r\nYounger children, especially those receiving enzyme inducing drugs, will require larger maintenance doses to\r\nattain targeted total and unbound valproate concentrations. Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10\r\nyears) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults. Over the age of 10\r\nyears, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults.\r\nThe variability in free fraction limits the clinical usefulness of monitoring total serum valproic acid\r\nconcentration. Interpretation of valproic acid concentrations in children should include consideration of factors\r\nthat affect hepatic metabolism and protein binding.\r\nPediatric Clinical Trials\r\nDepakote was studied in seven pediatric clinical trials.\r\nTwo of the pediatric studies were double-blinded placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of Depakote\r\nER for the indications of mania (150 patients aged 10 to 17 years, 76 of whom were on Depakote ER) and\r\nmigraine (304 patients aged 12 to 17 years, 231 of whom were on Depakote ER). Efficacy was not established\r\nfor either the treatment of migraine or the treatment of mania.\r\nThe remaining five trials were long term safety studies. Two six-month pediatric studies were conducted to\r\nevaluate the long-term safety of Depakote ER for the indication of mania (292 patients aged 10 to 17 years).\r\nTwo twelve-month pediatric studies were conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of Depakote ER for the\r\nindication of migraine (353 patients aged 12 to 17 years). One twelve-month study was conducted to evaluate\r\nthe safety of Depakote Sprinkle Capsules in the indication of partial seizures (169 patients aged 3 to 10 years).\r\nThe safety and tolerability of Depakote in pediatric patients were shown to be comparable to those in adults [see\r\nAdverse Reactions (6)].\r\nNonclinical Developmental Toxicology\r\nIn studies of valproate in immature animals, toxic effects not observed in adult animals included\r\nretinal dysplasia in rats treated during the neonatal period (from postnatal day 4) and nephrotoxicity in\r\nrats treated during the neonatal and juvenile (from postnatal day 14) periods. The no-effect dose for\r\nthese findings was less than the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis.\r\n8.5 Geriatric Use\r\nNo patients above the age of 65 years were enrolled in double-blind prospective clinical trials of\r\nmania associated with bipolar illness. In a case review study of 583 patients, 72 patients (12%) were\r\ngreater than 65 years of age. A higher percentage of patients above 65 years of age reported\r\naccidental injury, infection, pain, somnolence, and tremor.\r\nDiscontinuation of valproate was occasionally associated with the latter two events. It is not clear\r\nwhether these events indicate additional risk or whether they result from preexisting medical illness\r\nand concomitant medication use among these patients.\r\nA study of elderly patients with dementia revealed drug related somnolence and discontinuation for\r\nsomnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. The starting dose should be reduced in these\r\npatients, and dosage reductions or discontinuation should be considered in patients with excessive\r\nsomnolence [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].\r\nThere is insufficient information available to discern the safety and effectiveness of valproate for the\r\nprophylaxis of migraines in patients over 65.\r\nThe capacity of elderly patients (age range: 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to\r\nbe reduced compared to younger adults (age range: 22 to 26 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology\r\n(12.3)].\r\n8.6 Effect of Disease\r\nLiver Disease\r\n[(See Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5) and Clinical\r\nPharmacology (12.3)]. Liver disease impairs the capacity to eliminate valproate."

Mild to Moderate Alzheimerâ€™s Disease\r\nThe dosages of ARICEPT shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials\r\nare 5 mg and 10 mg administered once per day.\r\nThe higher dose of 10 mg did not provide a statistically significantly greater\r\nclinical benefit than 5 mg. There is a suggestion, however, based upon order\r\nof group mean scores and dose trend analyses of data from these clinical\r\ntrials, that a daily dose of 10 mg of ARICEPT might provide additional\r\nbenefit for some patients. Accordingly, whether or not to employ a dose of\r\n10 mg is a matter of prescriber and patient preference.\r\n\r\n2.2. Moderate to Severe Alzheimerâ€™s Disease\r\nARICEPT has been shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials at\r\ndoses of 10 mg and 23 mg administered once daily. Results of a controlled\r\nclinical trial in moderate to severe Alzheimerâ€™s Disease that compared\r\nARICEPT 23 mg once daily to 10 mg once daily suggest that a 23 mg dose\r\nof ARICEPT provided additional benefit.\r\n\r\n2.3. Titration\r\nThe recommended starting dose of ARICEPT is 5 mg once daily. Evidence\r\nfrom the controlled trials in mild to moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease indicates\r\nthat the 10 mg dose, with a one week titration, is likely to be associated with\r\na higher incidence of cholinergic adverse events compared to the 5 mg dose.\r\nIn open-label trials using a 6 week titration, the type and frequency of these\r\nsame adverse events were similar between the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups.\r\nTherefore, because ARICEPT steady state is achieved about 15 days after it\r\nis started and because the incidence of untoward effects may be influenced\r\nby the rate of dose escalation, a dose of 10 mg should not be administered\r\nuntil patients have been on a daily dose of 5 mg for 4 to 6 weeks. A dose of\r\n23 mg once daily can be administered once patients have been on a dose of\r\n10 mg once daily for at least 3 months. "

Cardiovascular Conditions\r\nBecause of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have\r\nvagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect\r\nmay manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and\r\nwithout known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal\r\nepisodes have been reported in association with the use of ARICEPT.\r\n\r\n5.3. Nausea and Vomiting\r\nARICEPT, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties,\r\nhas been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects,\r\nwhen they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with\r\nthe 5 mg/day dose, and more frequently with the 23 mg dose than with the\r\n10 mg dose. Specifically, in a controlled trial that compared a dose of 23\r\nmg/day to 10 mg/day in patients who had been treated with donepezil 10\r\nmg/day for at least three months, the incidence of nausea in the 23 mg\r\ngroup was markedly greater than in the patients who continued on 10\r\nmg/day (11.8% vs 3.4%, respectively), and the incidence of vomiting in the\r\n23 mg group was markedly greater than in the 10 mg group (9.2% vs 2.5%,\r\nrespectively). The percent of patients who discontinued treatment due to\r\nvomiting in the 23 mg group was markedly higher than in the 10 mg group\r\n(2.9% vs 0.4%, respectively).\r\nAlthough in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient,\r\nsometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued\r\nuse of ARICEPT, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of\r\ntreatment and after dose increases.\r\n\r\n5.4. Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding\r\nThrough their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to\r\nincrease gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity.\r\nTherefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or\r\noccult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for\r\ndeveloping ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those\r\nreceiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\r\nClinical studies of ARICEPT in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have\r\nshown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic\r\nulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Results of a controlled clinical\r\nstudy with 23 mg/day showed an increase, relative to 10 mg/day, in the\r\nincidence of peptic ulcer disease (0.4% vs. 0.2%) and gastrointestinal\r\nbleeding from any site (1.1% vs. 0.6%)\r\n\r\n5.5. Weight Loss\r\nWeight loss was reported as an adverse event in 4.7% of patients assigned\r\nto ARICEPT in a dose of 23 mg/day compared to 2.5% of patients assigned\r\nto 10 mg/day. Compared to their baseline weights, 8.4% of patients taking\r\n23 mg/day were found to have a weight decrease of â‰¥ 7% by the end of the\r\nstudy, while 4.9% of patients taking 10 mg/day were found to have weight\r\nloss of â‰¥ 7% at the end of the study.\r\n\r\n5.6. Genitourinary Conditions\r\nAlthough not observed in clinical trials of ARICEPT, cholinomimetics may\r\ncause bladder outflow obstruction.\r\n\r\n5.7. Neurological Conditions: Seizures\r\nCholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized\r\nconvulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of\r\nAlzheimerâ€™s disease.\r\n\r\n5.8. Pulmonary Conditions\r\nBecause of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be\r\nprescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive\r\npulmonary disease.

An open-label study was\r\nconducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15 and 30-week\r\nstudies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week\r\nperiod.

The\r\nrange of patient exposure is from 1 to 1214 days.\r\nTreatment emergent signs and symptoms that occurred during three\r\ncontrolled clinical trials and two open-label trials in the United States were\r\nrecorded as adverse events by the clinical investigators using terminology\r\nof their own choosing. To provide an overall estimate of the proportion of\r\nindividuals having similar types of events, the events were grouped into a\r\nsmaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART\r\ndictionary, and event frequencies were calculated across all studies. These\r\ncategories are used in the listing below. The frequencies represent the\r\nproportion of 900 patients from these trials who experienced that event\r\nwhile receiving ARICEPT. All adverse events occurring at least twice are\r\nincluded, except for those already listed in Tables 2 or 3, COSTART terms\r\ntoo general to be informative, or events less likely to be drug related. Events\r\nare classified by body system and listed using the following definitions:\r\nFrequent adverse events - those occurring in at least 1/100 patients;\r\nInfrequent adverse events - those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients.\r\nThese adverse events are not necessarily related to ARICEPT treatment and\r\nin most cases were observed at a similar frequency in placebo treated\r\npatients in the controlled studies. No important additional adverse events\r\nwere seen in studies conducted outside the United States.\r\nBody as a Whole: Frequent: influenza, chest pain, toothache; Infrequent:\r\nfever, edema face, periorbital edema, hernia hiatal, abscess, cellulitis, chills,\r\ngeneralized coldness, head fullness, listlessness.\r\nCardiovascular System: Frequent: hypertension, vasodilation, atrial\r\nfibrillation, hot flashes, hypotension; Infrequent: angina pectoris, postural\r\nhypotension, myocardial infarction, AV block (first degree), congestive\r\nheart failure, arteritis, bradycardia, peripheral vascular disease,\r\nsupraventricular tachycardia, deep vein thrombosis.\r\nDigestive System: Frequent: fecal incontinence, gastrointestinal bleeding,\r\nbloating, epigastric pain; Infrequent: eructation, gingivitis, increased\r\nappetite, flatulence, periodontal abscess, cholelithiasis, diverticulitis,\r\ndrooling, dry mouth, fever sore, gastritis, irritable colon, tongue edema,\r\nepigastric distress, gastroenteritis, increased transaminases, hemorrhoids,\r\nileus, increased thirst, jaundice, melena, polydipsia, duodenal ulcer,\r\nstomach ulcer.\r\nEndocrine System: Infrequent: diabetes mellitus, goiter.\r\nHemic and Lymphatic System: Infrequent: anemia, thrombocythemia,\r\nthrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, erythrocytopenia.\r\nMetabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Frequent: dehydration; Infrequent:\r\ngout, hypokalemia, increased creatine kinase, hyperglycemia, weight\r\nincrease, increased lactate dehydrogenase.\r\nMusculoskeletal System: Frequent: bone fracture; Infrequent: muscle\r\nweakness, muscle fasciculation.\r\nNervous System: Frequent: delusions, tremor, irritability, paresthesia,\r\naggression, vertigo, ataxia, increased libido, restlessness, abnormal crying,\r\nnervousness, aphasia; Infrequent: cerebrovascular accident, intracranial\r\nhemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, emotional lability, neuralgia,\r\ncoldness (localized), muscle spasm, dysphoria, gait abnormality,\r\nhypertonia, hypokinesia, neurodermatitis, numbness (localized), paranoia,\r\ndysarthria, dysphasia, hostility, decreased libido, melancholia, emotional\r\nwithdrawal, nystagmus, pacing.\r\nRespiratory System: Frequent: dyspnea, sore throat, bronchitis;\r\nInfrequent: epistaxis, post nasal drip, pneumonia, hyperventilation,\r\npulmonary congestion, wheezing, hypoxia, pharyngitis, pleurisy, pulmonary\r\ncollapse, sleep apnea, snoring.\r\nSkin and Appendages: Frequent: pruritus, diaphoresis, urticaria;\r\nInfrequent: dermatitis, erythema, skin discoloration, hyperkeratosis,\r\nalopecia, fungal dermatitis, herpes zoster, hirsutism, skin striae, night\r\nsweats, skin ulcer.\r\nSpecial Senses: Frequent: cataract, eye irritation, vision blurred;\r\nInfrequent: dry eyes, glaucoma, earache, tinnitus, blepharitis, decreased\r\nhearing, retinal hemorrhage, otitis externa, otitis media, bad taste,\r\nconjunctival hemorrhage, ear buzzing, motion sickness, spots before eyes.\r\nUrogenital System: Frequent: urinary incontinence, nocturia; Infrequent:\r\ndysuria, hematuria, urinary urgency, metrorrhagia, cystitis, enuresis,\r\nprostate hypertrophy, pyelonephritis, inability to empty bladder, breast\r\nfibroadenosis, fibrocystic breast, mastitis, pyuria, renal failure, vaginitis.\r\nSevere Alzheimerâ€™s Disease\r\nAdverse Events Leading to Discontinuation\r\nThe rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of ARICEPT due\r\nto adverse events for the ARICEPT patients were approximately 12%\r\ncompared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse events\r\nleading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of\r\nARICEPT patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were\r\nanorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2%\r\nvs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo).\r\nMost Frequent Adverse Events Seen in Association with the Use of\r\nARICEPT\r\nThe most common adverse events, defined as those occurring at a frequency\r\nof at least 5% in patients receiving ARICEPT and at twice or more the\r\nplacebo rate, are largely predicted by ARICEPTâ€™s cholinomimetic effects.\r\nThese include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis.

Effect of ARICEPT on the Metabolism of Other Drugs\r\nNo in vivo clinical trials have investigated the effect of ARICEPT on the\r\nclearance of drugs metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine) or\r\nby CYP 2D6 (e.g. imipramine). However, in vitro studies show a low rate\r\nof binding to these enzymes (mean Ki about 50-130 ï­M), that, given the\r\ntherapeutic plasma concentrations of donepezil (164 nM), indicates little\r\nlikelihood of interference.\r\nWhether ARICEPT has any potential for enzyme induction is not known.\r\nFormal pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of ARICEPT for\r\ninteraction with theophylline, cimetidine, warfarin, digoxin and\r\nketoconazole. No effects of ARICEPT on the pharmacokinetics of these\r\ndrugs were observed.\r\n\r\n7.2. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of ARICEPT\r\nKetoconazole and quinidine, inhibitors of CYP450, 3A4 and 2D6,\r\nrespectively, inhibit donepezil metabolism in vitro. Whether there is a\r\nclinical effect of quinidine is not known. In a 7-day crossover study in 18\r\nhealthy volunteers, ketoconazole (200 mg q.d.) increased mean donepezil\r\n(5 mg q.d.) concentrations (AUC0-24 and Cmax) by 36%. The clinical\r\nrelevance of this increase in concentration is unknown.\r\nA small effect of CYP2D6 inhibitors was identified in a population\r\npharmacokinetic analysis of plasma donepezil concentrations measured in\r\npatients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Donepezil clearance was reduced by\r\napproximately 17% in patients taking 10 or 23 mg in combination with a\r\nknown CYP2D6 inhibitor. This result is consistent with the conclusion that\r\nCYP2D6 is a minor metabolic pathway of donepezil.\r\nInducers of CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine,\r\ndexamethasone, rifampin, and phenobarbital) could increase the rate of\r\nelimination of ARICEPT.\r\nFormal pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of\r\nARICEPT is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of\r\ndigoxin or cimetidine.\r\n\r\n7.3. Use with Anticholinergics\r\nBecause of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the\r\npotential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications.\r\n\r\n7.4. Use with Cholinomimetics and Other Cholinesterase Inhibitors\r\nA synergistic effect may be expected when cholinesterase inhibitors are\r\ngiven concurrently with succinylcholine, similar neuromuscular blocking\r\nagents or cholinergic agonists such as bethanechol.

ARICEPT should be used during pregnancy only if the\r\npotential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\r\nOral administration of donepezil to pregnant rats and rabbits during the\r\nperiod of organogenesis did not produce any teratogenic effects at doses up\r\nto 16 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 times the maximum recommended\r\nhuman dose [MRHD] of 23 mg/day on a mg/m2\r\n basis) and 10 mg/kg/day\r\n(approximately 7 times the MRHD on a mg/m2\r\n basis), respectively. Oral\r\nadministration of donepezil (1, 3, 10 mg/kg/day) to rats during late gestation\r\nand throughout lactation to weaning produced an increase in stillbirths and\r\nreduced offspring survival through postpartum day 4 at the highest dose.\r\nThe no-effect dose of 3 mg/kg/day is approximately equal to the MRHD on\r\na mg/m2 basis.\r\n\r\n8.2.

Pediatric Use\r\nThe safety and effectiveness of ARICEPT in children have not been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n8.4. Geriatric Use\r\nAlzheimerâ€™s disease is a disorder occurring primarily in individuals over 55\r\nyears of age. The mean age of patients enrolled in the clinical studies with\r\nARICEPT was 73 years; 80% of these patients were between 65 and 84\r\nyears old, and 49% of patients were at or above the age of 75. The efficacy\r\nand safety data presented in the clinical trials section were obtained from\r\nthese patients.

Lower Weight Individuals\r\nIn the controlled clinical trial, among patients in the ARICEPT 23 mg\r\ntreatment group, those patients weighing < 55 kg reported more nausea,\r\nvomiting, and decreased weight than patients weighing 55 kg or more.\r\nThere were more withdrawals due to adverse events as well.

Because of the risks of severe\r\nneutropenia and of seizure associated with its use, VERSACLOZ should be used only in patients\r\nwho have failed to respond adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1, 5.4)].\r\nThe effectiveness of clozapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was demonstrated in a 6Â­\r\nweek, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study comparing clozapine and\r\nchlorpromazine in patients who had failed other antipsychotics [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\r\n\r\n1.2 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrent Suicidal Behavior in Schizophrenia or\r\nSchizoaffective Disorder\r\nVERSACLOZ is indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with\r\nschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for reexperiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior\r\nrefers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death.\r\nThe effectiveness of clozapine in reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior was\r\ndemonstrated over a two-year treatment period in the InterSePTâ„¢ trial [see Clinical Studies\r\n(14.2)]."

The baseline\r\nANC must be at least 1500/ÂµL for the general population, and at least 1000/ÂµL for patients with\r\ndocumented Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN). To continue treatment, the ANC must be\r\nmonitored regularly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\r\n\r\n2.2 Dosing Information\r\nThe starting dose is 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily dose can be increased in\r\nincrements of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to achieve a target dose of 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the dose\r\ncan be increased once weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg. The maximum\r\ndose is 900 mg per day. To minimize the risk of orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, and\r\nsyncope, it is necessary to use this low starting dose, gradual titration schedule, and divided\r\ndosages [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\r\n\r\n2.3 Important Administration Instructions\r\nVERSACLOZ Oral Suspension is administered to the mouth by the oral syringes provided (1 mL\r\nor 9 mL). After shaking the bottle for 10 seconds prior to each use, the syringe adaptor is pressed\r\non top of the bottle. The oral syringe (1 mL or 9 mL) is filled with air, and inserted into the\r\nadaptor. The air is dispelled into the bottle and then the bottle is turned upside down. The\r\nprescribed amount of the suspension is drawn from the bottle and dispensed directly to the\r\nmouth. The prescribed dose should be administered immediately after it is prepared. Do not draw\r\na dose and store it in the syringe for later use. After use, the oral syringe may be washed with\r\nwarm water and dried for next use. The bottle may be closed with the same cap without\r\nremoving the bottle adaptor. Educate patients and caregivers on the steps to administer\r\nVERSACLOZ as described in the Patient Instructions for Use.\r\nVERSACLOZ can be taken with or without food [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].\r\n\r\n2.4 Maintenance Treatment\r\nGenerally, patients responding to VERSACLOZ should continue maintenance treatment on their\r\neffective dose beyond the acute episode.\r\n\r\n2.5 Discontinuation of Treatment\r\nMethod of treatment discontinuation will vary depending on the patientâ€™s last ANC:\r\nï‚·\t See Tables 2 or 3 for appropriate ANC monitoring based on the level of neutropenia if abrupt\r\ntreatment discontinuation is necessary because of moderate to severe neutropenia.\r\nï‚·\t Reduce the dose gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks if termination of VERSACLOZ\r\ntherapy is planned and there is no evidence of moderate to severe neutropenia.\r\nï‚·\t For abrupt clozapine discontinuation for a reason unrelated to neutropenia, continuation of\r\nthe existing ANC monitoring is recommended for general population patients until their\r\nANC is â‰¥1500/ÂµL and for BEN patients until their ANC is â‰¥1000/ÂµL or above their baseline.\r\nï‚·\t Additional ANC monitoring is required for any patient reporting onset of fever (temperature\r\nof 38.5Â°C or 101.3Â°F, or greater) during the 2 weeks after discontinuation [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1)].\r\nï‚·\t Monitor all patients carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and symptoms\r\nrelated to cholinergic rebound such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and\r\ndiarrhea.\r\n\r\n2.6 Re-Initiation of Treatment\r\nWhen restarting VERSACLOZ in patients who have discontinued VERSACLOZ (i.e., 2 days or\r\nmore since the last dose), re-initiate with 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. This is necessary to minimize the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions\r\n(5.3)]. If that dose is well tolerated, the dose may be increased to the previously therapeutic dose\r\nmore quickly than recommended for initial treatment.\r\n\r\n2.7 Dosage Adjustments with Concomitant use of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 Inhibitors\r\nor CYP1A2, CYP3A4 Inducers\r\nDose adjustments may be necessary in patients with concomitant use of: strong CYP1A2\r\ninhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin); moderate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors\r\n(e.g., oral contraceptives, or caffeine); CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine,\r\nescitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine,\r\nor sertraline); CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. Johnâ€™s wort, and rifampin);\r\nor CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., tobacco smoking) (Table 1) [see Drug Interactions (7)].\r\nTable 1: Dose Adjustment in Patients Taking Concomitant Medications\r\nCo-medications Scenarios\r\n Initiating Adding a Discontinuing a\r\nVERSACLOZ co-medication co-medication\r\nwhile taking a while taking while continuing\r\nco-medication VERSACLOZ VERSACLOZ\r\nStrong CYP1A2 Use one third of the VERSACLOZ dose.

The ANC is usually available\r\nas a component of the complete blood count (CBC), including differential, and is more relevant\r\nto drug-induced neutropenia than is the white blood cell (WBC) count. The ANC may also be\r\ncalculated using the following formula: ANC equals the Total WBC count multiplied by the total\r\npercentage of neutrophils obtained from the differential (neutrophil â€œsegsâ€ plus neutrophil\r\nâ€œbandsâ€). Other granulocytes (basophils and eosinophils) contribute minimally to neutropenia\r\nand their measurement is not necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Neutropenia may be mild,\r\nmoderate, or severe (see Tables 2 and 3). To improve and standardize understanding, â€œsevere\r\nneutropeniaâ€ replaces the previous terms severe leukopenia, severe granulocytopenia, or\r\nagranulocytosis.\r\nSevere neutropenia, ANC less than (<) 500/ÂµL, occurs in a small percentage of patients taking\r\nVERSACLOZ and is associated with an increase in the risk of serious and potentially fatal\r\ninfections. Risk of neutropenia appears greatest during the first 18 weeks on treatment and then\r\ndeclines. The mechanism by which VERSACLOZ causes neutropenia is unknown and is not\r\ndose-dependent.\r\nTwo separate management algorithms are provided below, the first for patients in the general\r\npopulation, and the second for patients identified to have baseline neutropenia.\r\nVERSACLOZ Treatment and Monitoring in the General Patient Population (see Table 2)\r\nObtain a CBC, including the ANC value, prior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ to\r\nensure the presence of a normal baseline neutrophil count (equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL) and\r\nto permit later comparisons. Patients in the general population with an ANC equal to or greater\r\nthan (â‰¥)1500/ÂµL are considered within normal range (Table 2) and are eligible to initiate\r\ntreatment. Weekly ANC monitoring is required for all patients during the first 6 months of\r\ntreatment. If a patientâ€™s ANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL for the first 6 months of\r\ntreatment, monitoring frequency may be reduced to every 2 weeks for the next 6 months. If the\r\nANC remains equal to or greater than 1500/ÂµL for the second 6 months of continuous therapy,\r\nANC monitoring frequency may be reduced to once every 4 weeks thereafter.\r\nTable 2: VERSACLOZ Treatment Recommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count\r\n(ANC) Monitoring for the General Patient Population\r\nANC Level VERSACLOZ\r\nTreatment Recommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nNormal range\r\n(â‰¥1500/ÂµL)\r\nï‚· Initiate treatment\r\nï‚· If treatment interrupted:\r\n- <30 days, continue\r\nmonitoring as before\r\n- â‰¥30 days, monitor as if new\r\npatient\r\nï‚· Weekly from initiation to\r\n6 months\r\nï‚· Every 2 weeks from 6 to\r\n12 months\r\nï‚· Monthly after 12 months\r\nï‚· Discontinuation for reasons\r\nother than neutropenia\r\nï‚· See Section 2.4\r\nMild Neutropenia ï‚· Continue treatment ï‚· Three times weekly until\r\n(1000 to 1499/ÂµL)* ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL, return\r\nto patientâ€™s last â€œNormal\r\nRangeâ€ ANC monitoring\r\ninterval**\r\nModerate ï‚· Recommend hematology ï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL,\r\nNeutropenia consultation then\r\n(500 to 999/ÂµL)* ï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapine-induced\r\nneutropenia\r\nï‚· Resume treatment once ANC\r\nâ‰¥1000/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL, check\r\nANC weekly for 4 weeks,\r\nthen return to patientâ€™s last\r\nâ€œNormal Rangeâ€ ANC\r\nmonitoring interval**\r\nSevere Neutropenia ï‚· Recommend hematology ï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL,\r\n(less than 500/ÂµL)* consultation\r\nï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapine-induced\r\nneutropenia\r\nï‚· Do not rechallenge unless\r\nprescriber determines benefits\r\noutweigh risks\r\nthen\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\nï‚· If patient rechallenged,\r\nresume treatment as a new\r\npatient under â€œNormal\r\nRangeâ€ monitoring once \r\nANC Level VERSACLOZ\r\nTreatment Recommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nANC â‰¥1500/ÂµL\r\n* Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/ÂµL with a repeat ANC measurement within\r\n24 hours\r\n** If clinically appropriate\r\nVERSACLOZ Treatment and Monitoring in Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (see Table\r\n3)\r\nBenign ethnic neutropenia (BEN) is a condition observed in certain ethnic groups whose average\r\nANC values are lower than â€œstandardâ€ laboratory ranges for neutrophils. It is most commonly\r\nobserved in individuals of African descent (approximate prevalence of 25-50%), some Middle\r\nEastern ethnic groups, and in other non-Caucasian ethnic groups with darker skin. BEN is more\r\ncommon in men. Patients with BEN have normal hematopoietic stem-cell number and myeloid\r\nmaturation, are healthy, and do not suffer from repeated or severe infections. They are not at\r\nincreased risk for developing VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia. Additional evaluation may be\r\nneeded to determine if baseline neutropenia is due to BEN. Consider hematology consultation\r\nbefore initiating or during VERSACLOZ treatment as necessary.\r\nPatients with BEN require a different ANC algorithm for VERSACLOZ management due to\r\ntheir lower baseline ANC levels. Table 3 provides guidelines for managing VERSACLOZ\r\ntreatment and ANC monitoring in patients with BEN.\r\nTable 3: Patients with Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN); VERSACLOZ Treatment\r\nRecommendations Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) Monitoring\r\nANC Level Treatment\r\nRecommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nNormal BEN Range\r\n(Established ANC\r\nbaseline â‰¥1000/ÂµL )\r\nï‚· Obtain at least two\r\nbaseline ANC levels\r\nbefore initiating\r\ntreatment\r\nï‚· If treatment interrupted\r\n- <30 days, continue\r\nmonitoring as\r\nbefore\r\n- â‰¥30 days, monitor\r\nas if new patient\r\nï‚· Weekly from initiation to\r\n6 months\r\nï‚· Every 2 weeks from 6 to\r\n12 months\r\nï‚· Monthly after 12 months\r\nï‚· Discontinuation of\r\ntreatment for reasons\r\nother than neutropenia\r\nï‚· See Section 2.4\r\nANC Level Treatment\r\nRecommendations\r\nANC Monitoring\r\nBEN\r\nNeutropenia\r\n(500 to 999/ÂµL)*\r\nï‚· Recommend\r\nhematology\r\nconsultation\r\nï‚· Continue treatment\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until ANC\r\nâ‰¥1000/ÂµL or â‰¥patientâ€™s known\r\nbaseline\r\nï‚· Once ANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL or at\r\npatientâ€™s known baseline, check\r\nANC weekly for 4 weeks, then\r\nreturn to patientâ€™s last â€œNormal\r\nBEN Rangeâ€ ANC monitoring\r\ninterval.**\r\nBEN\r\nSevere Neutropenia\r\n(less than 500/ÂµL)*\r\nï‚· Recommend\r\nhematology\r\nconsultation\r\nï‚· Interrupt treatment for\r\nsuspected clozapineinduced neutropenia\r\nï‚· Do not rechallenge\r\nunless prescriber\r\ndetermines benefits\r\noutweigh risks\r\nï‚· Daily until ANC â‰¥500/ÂµL, then\r\nï‚· Three times weekly until ANC â‰¥\r\npatientâ€™s baseline\r\nï‚· If patient rechallenged, resume\r\ntreatment as a new patient under\r\nâ€œNormal Rangeâ€ monitoring once\r\nANC â‰¥1000/ÂµL or at patientâ€™s\r\nbaseline\r\n* Confirm all initial reports of ANC less than 1500/ÂµL with a repeat ANC measurement within 24 hours\r\n** If clinically appropriate\r\nGeneral Guidelines for Management of All Patients with Fever or with Neutropenia\r\nï‚·\t Fever: Interrupt VERSACLOZ as a precautionary measure in any patient who develops\r\nfever, defined as a temperature of 38.5Â°C [101.3Â°F] or greater, and obtain an ANC level.\r\nFever is often the first sign of neutropenic infection.\r\nï‚·\t ANC less than 1000/ÂµL: If fever occurs in any patient with an ANC less than 1000/ÂµL,\r\ninitiate appropriate workup and treatment for infection and refer to Tables 2 or 3 for\r\nmanagement.\r\nï‚·\t Consider hematology consultation.\r\nï‚·\t See Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Fever under WARNINGS AND\r\nPRECAUTIONS (5) and Instructions for Patients, under PATIENT COUNSELING\r\nINFORMATION (17).\r\nRechallenge after an ANC less than 500/ÂµL (severe neutropenia)\r\nFor some patients who experience severe VERSACLOZ-related neutropenia, the risk of serious\r\npsychiatric illness from discontinuing VERSACLOZ treatment may be greater than the risk of\r\nrechallenge (e.g., patients with severe schizophrenic illness who have no treatment options other\r\nthan VERSACLOZ). A hematology consultation may be useful in deciding to rechallenge a\r\npatient. In general, however, do not rechallenge patients who develop severe neutropenia with\r\nVERSACLOZ or a clozapine product.\r\nIf a patient will be rechallenged, the clinician should consider thresholds provided in Tables 2\r\nand 3, the patientâ€™s medical and psychiatric history, a discussion with the patient and his/her caregiver about the benefits and risks of VERSACLOZ rechallenge, and the severity and\r\ncharacteristics of the neutropenic episode.\r\nUsing VERSACLOZ with Other Drugs Associated with Neutropenia\r\nIt is unclear if concurrent use of other drugs known to cause neutropenia increases the risk or\r\nseverity of VERSACLOZ-induced neutropenia. There is no strong scientific rationale to avoid\r\nVERSACLOZ treatment in patients concurrently treated with these drugs. If VERSACLOZ is\r\nused concurrently with an agent known to cause neutropenia (e.g., some chemotherapeutic\r\nagents), consider monitoring patients more closely than the treatment guidelines provided in\r\nTables 2 and 3. Consult with the treating oncologist in patients receiving concomitant\r\nchemotherapy.\r\n\r\n5.2 Clozapine REMS Program\r\nVERSACLOZ is only available through a restricted program under a REMS called the Clozapine\r\nREMS Program because of the risk of severe neutropenia.\r\nNotable requirements of the Clozapine REMS Program include:\r\nï‚· Healthcare professionals who prescribe VERSACLOZ must be certified with the program by\r\nenrolling and completing training.\r\nï‚· Patients who receive VERSACLOZ must be enrolled in the program and comply with the\r\nANC testing and monitoring requirements.\r\nï‚· Pharmacies dispensing VERSACLOZ must be certified with the program by enrolling and\r\ncompleting training and must only dispense to patients who are eligible to receive\r\nVERSACLOZ.\r\nFurther information is available at www.clozapinerems.com or 1-844-267-8678.\r\n\r\n5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope\r\nHypotension, bradycardia, syncope, and cardiac arrest have occurred with clozapine treatment.\r\nThe risk is highest during the initial titration period, particularly with rapid dose-escalation.\r\nThese reactions can occur with the first dose, at doses as low as 12.5 mg. These reactions can be\r\nfatal. The syndrome is consistent with neurally mediated reflex bradycardia (NMRB).\r\nTreatment must begin at a maximum dose of 12.5 mg once daily or twice daily. The total daily\r\ndose can be increased in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg per day, if well-tolerated, to a target dose\r\nof 300 mg to 450 mg per day (administered in divided doses) by the end of 2 weeks.\r\nSubsequently, the dose can be increased weekly or twice weekly, in increments of up to 100 mg.\r\nThe maximum dose is 900 mg per day. Use cautious titration and a divided dosage schedule to\r\nminimize the risk of serious cardiovascular reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\r\nConsider reducing the dose if hypotension occurs. When restarting patients who have had even a\r\nbrief interval off VERSACLOZ (i.e., 2 days or more since the last dose), re-initiate treatment at\r\n12.5 mg once daily or twice daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].\r\nUse VERSACLOZ cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial\r\ninfarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and\r\nconditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (e.g., concomitant use of\r\nantihypertensives, dehydration and hypovolemia).\r\n\r\n5.4 Seizures\r\nSeizure has been estimated to occur in association with clozapine use at a cumulative incidence\r\nat one year of approximately 5%, based on the occurrence of one or more seizures in 61 of\r\n1743 patients exposed to clozapine during its clinical testing prior to domestic marketing (i.e., a\r\ncrude rate of 3.5%). The risk of seizure is dose-related. Initiate treatment with a low dose (12.5\r\nmg), titrate slowly, and use divided dosing.\r\nUse caution when administering VERSACLOZ to patients with a history of seizures or other\r\npredisposing risk factors for seizure (e.g., head trauma or other CNS pathology, use of\r\nmedications that lower the seizure threshold, or alcohol abuse). Because of the substantial risk of\r\nseizure associated with VERSACLOZ use, caution patients about engaging in any activity where\r\nsudden loss of consciousness could cause serious risk to themselves or others (e.g., driving an\r\nautomobile, operating complex machinery, swimming, climbing).\r\n\r\n5.5 Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy\r\nMyocarditis and cardiomyopathy have occurred with the use of clozapine. These reactions can be\r\nfatal. Discontinue VERSACLOZ and obtain a cardiac evaluation upon suspicion of myocarditis\r\nor cardiomyopathy. Generally, patients with a history of clozapine-associated myocarditis or\r\ncardiomyopathy should not be rechallenged with VERSACLOZ. However, if the benefit of\r\nVERSACLOZ treatment is judged to outweigh the potential risks of recurrent myocarditis or\r\ncardiomyopathy, the clinician may consider rechallenge with VERSACLOZ in consultation with\r\na cardiologist, after a complete cardiac evaluation, and under close monitoring.\r\nConsider the possibility of myocarditis or cardiomyopathy in patients receiving VERSACLOZ\r\nwho present with chest pain, dyspnea, persistent tachycardia at rest, palpitations, fever, flu-like\r\nsymptoms, hypotension, other signs or symptoms of heart failure, or electrocardiographic\r\nfindings (low voltages, ST-T abnormalities, arrhythmias, right axis deviation, and poor R wave\r\nprogression). Myocarditis most frequently presents within the first two months of clozapine\r\ntreatment. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy generally occur later than clozapine-associated\r\nmyocarditis and usually after 8 weeks of treatment. However, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy\r\ncan occur at any period during treatment with VERSACLOZ. It is common for nonspecific flulike symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain, and low-grade fevers to precede\r\nmore overt signs of heart failure. Typical laboratory findings include elevated troponin I or T,\r\nelevated creatinine kinase-MB, peripheral eosinophilia, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).\r\nChest roentgenogram may demonstrate cardiac silhouette enlargement, and cardiac imaging\r\n(echocardiogram, radionucleotide studies, or cardiac catheterization) may reveal evidence of left\r\nventricular dysfunction.\r\n\r\n5.6 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis\r\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an\r\nincreased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks),\r\nlargely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated\r\npatients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course\r\nof a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%,\r\ncompared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were\r\nvaried, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death)\r\nor infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical\r\nantipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality in\r\nthis population. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies\r\nmay be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is\r\nnot clear. VERSACLOZ is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related\r\npsychosis [see Boxed Warning].\r\n\r\n5.7 Eosinophilia\r\nEosinophilia, defined as a blood eosinophil count of greater than 700/ÂµL, has occurred with\r\nclozapine treatment. In clinical trials, approximately 1% of patients developed eosinophilia.\r\nClozapine-related eosinophilia usually occurs during the first month of treatment. In some\r\npatients, it has been associated with myocarditis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, colitis, and nephritis.\r\nSuch organ involvement could be consistent with a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic\r\nsymptoms syndrome (DRESS), also known as drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS).\r\nIf eosinophilia develops during VERSACLOZ treatment, evaluate promptly for signs and\r\nsymptoms of systemic reactions, such as rash or other allergic symptoms, myocarditis, or other\r\norgan-specific disease associated with eosinophilia. If clozapine-related systemic disease is\r\nsuspected, discontinue VERSACLOZ immediately.\r\nIf a cause of eosinophilia unrelated to clozapine is identified (e.g., asthma, allergies, collagen\r\nvascular disease, parasitic infections, and specific neoplasms), treat the underlying cause and\r\ncontinue VERSACLOZ.\r\nClozapine-related eosinophilia has also occurred in the absence of organ involvement and can\r\nresolve without intervention. There are reports of successful rechallenge after discontinuation of\r\nclozapine, without recurrence of eosinophilia. In the absence of organ involvement, continue\r\nVERSACLOZ under careful monitoring. If the total eosinophil count continues to increase over\r\nseveral weeks in the absence of systemic disease, the decision to interrupt VERSACLOZ therapy\r\nand rechallenge after the eosinophil count decreases should be based on the overall clinical\r\nassessment, in consultation with an internist or hematologist.\r\n\r\n5.8 QT Interval Prolongation\r\nQT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes and other life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac\r\narrest, and sudden death have occurred with clozapine treatment. When prescribing\r\nVERSACLOZ, consider the presence of additional risk factors for QT prolongation and serious\r\ncardiovascular reactions. Conditions that increase these risks include the following: history of QT prolongation, long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac\r\ndeath, significant cardiac arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure,\r\ntreatment with other medications that cause QT prolongation, treatment with medications that inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ, and electrolyte abnormalities.\r\nPrior to initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ, perform a careful physical examination, medical\r\nhistory, and concomitant medication history. Consider obtaining a baseline ECG and serum\r\nchemistry panel. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Discontinue VERSACLOZ if the QTc\r\ninterval exceeds 500 msec. If patients experience symptoms consistent with Torsades de Pointes\r\nor other arrhythmias, (e.g., syncope, presyncope, dizziness, or palpitations), obtain a cardiac\r\nevaluation and discontinue VERSACLOZ.\r\nUse caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific\r\nantipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine,\r\ndroperidol, pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin,\r\nsparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III\r\nantiarrhythmic (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate,\r\nmethadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus).\r\nVERSACLOZ is primarily metabolized by CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4. Concomitant\r\ntreatment with inhibitors of these enzymes can increase the concentration of VERSACLOZ [see\r\nDrug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\r\nHypokalemia and hypomagnesemia increase the risk of QT prolongation. Hypokalemia can\r\nresult from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Use caution when treating patients at risk\r\nfor significant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalemia. Obtain baseline measurements\r\nof serum potassium and magnesium levels, and periodically monitor electrolytes. Correct\r\nelectrolyte abnormalities before initiating treatment with VERSACLOZ.\r\n\r\n5.9 Metabolic Changes\r\nAtypical antipsychotic drugs, including VERSACLOZ, have been associated with metabolic\r\nchanges that can increase cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes\r\ninclude hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While atypical antipsychotic drugs\r\nmay produce some metabolic changes, each drug in the class has its own specific risk profile.\r\nHyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus\r\nHyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma\r\nor death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including\r\nVERSACLOZ. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose\r\nabnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes\r\nmellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the\r\ngeneral population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use\r\nand hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However,\r\nepidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent, hyperglycemia-related\r\nadverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not\r\navailable.\r\nPatients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on VERSACLOZ\r\nshould be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for\r\ndiabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with\r\natypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of\r\ntreatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics\r\nshould be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia,\r\nand weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical\r\nantipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has\r\nresolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required\r\ncontinuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.\r\nIn a pooled data analysis of 8 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, the mean changes in\r\nfasting glucose concentration in the clozapine and chlorpromazine groups were +11 mg/dL and\r\n+4 mg/dL respectively. A higher proportion of the clozapine group demonstrated categorical\r\nincreases from baseline in fasting glucose concentrations, compared to the chlorpromazine group\r\n(Table 4). The clozapine doses were 100-900 mg per day (mean modal dose: 512 mg per day).\r\nThe maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg per day (mean modal dose: 1029 mg per day).\r\nThe median duration of exposure was 42 days for clozapine and chlorpromazine.\r\nTable 4: Categorical Changes in Fasting Glucose Level in Studies in Adult Subjects with\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change\r\n(at least once) from\r\nbaseline\r\nTreatment Arm N n (%)\r\nNormal\r\n(<100 mg/dL) Clozapine 198 53 (27)\r\nFasting Glucose\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥126 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 135 14 (10)\r\nBorderline\r\n(100 to 125 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥126 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 57 24 (42)\r\nChlorpromazine 43 12 (28)\r\nDyslipidemia\r\nUndesirable alterations in lipids have occurred in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics,\r\nincluding VERSACLOZ. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid\r\nevaluations in patients using VERSACLOZ, is recommended.\r\nIn a pooled data analysis of 10 studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment\r\nwas associated with increases in serum total cholesterol. No data were collected on LDL and\r\nHDL cholesterol. The mean increase in total cholesterol was 13 mg/dL in the clozapine group\r\nand 15 mg/dL in the chlorpromazine group. In a pooled data analysis of 2 studies in adult\r\nsubjects with schizophrenia, clozapine treatment was associated with increases in fasting serum\r\ntriglyceride. The mean increase in fasting triglyceride was 71 mg/dL (54%) in the clozapine group and 39 mg/dL (35%) in the chlorpromazine group (Table 5). In addition, clozapine\r\ntreatment was associated with categorical increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, as\r\nillustrated in Table 6. The proportion of patients with categorical increases in total cholesterol or\r\nfasting triglyceride increased with the duration of exposure. The median duration of clozapine\r\nand chlorpromazine exposure was 45 days and 38 days, respectively. The clozapine dose range\r\nwas 100 mg to 900 mg daily; the maximum chlorpromazine dose was 1800 mg daily.\r\nTable 5: Mean Changes in Total Cholesterol and Triglyceride Concentration in Studies in\r\nAdult Subjects with Schizophrenia\r\nTreatment Arm Baseline total cholesterol\r\nconcentration (mg/dL)\r\nChange from baseline\r\nmg/dL (%)\r\nClozapine (N=334) 184 +13 (7)\r\nChlorpromazine (N=185) 182 +15 (8)\r\nBaseline triglyceride\r\nconcentration (mg/dL)\r\nChange from baseline\r\nmg/dL (%)\r\nClozapine (N=6) 130 +71 (54)\r\nChlorpromazine (N=7) 110 +39 (35)\r\nTable 6: Categorical Changes in Lipid Concentrations in Studies in Adult Subjects with\r\nSchizophrenia\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change (at\r\nleast once) from\r\nBaseline\r\nTreatment\r\nArm N n (%)\r\nTotal\r\nCholesterol\r\n(random or\r\nfasting)\r\nIncrease by â‰¥40 mg/dL\r\nClozapine 334 111 (33)\r\nChlorpromazine 185 46 (25)\r\nNormal (<200 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥240 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 222 18 (8)\r\nChlorpromazine 132 3 (2)\r\nBorderline\r\n(200 - 239 mg/dL) to\r\nHigh (â‰¥240 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 79 30 (38)\r\nChlorpromazine 34 14 (41)\r\nTriglycerides\r\n(fasting)\r\nIncrease by â‰¥50 mg/dL\r\nClozapine 6 3 (50)\r\nChlorpromazine 7 3 (43)\r\nNormal (<150 mg/dL)\r\nto\r\nHigh (â‰¥200 mg/dL)\r\nClozapine 4 0 (0)\r\nChlorpromazine 6 2 (33)\r\nBorderline\r\n(â‰¥150 mg/dL and Clozapine 1 1 (100)\r\nLaboratory\r\nParameter\r\nCategory Change (at\r\nleast once) from\r\nBaseline\r\nTreatment\r\nArm N n (%)\r\n<200 mg/dL) to\r\nHigh (â‰¥200 mg/dL) Chlorpromazine 1 0 (0)\r\nWeight Gain\r\nWeight gain has occurred with the use of antipsychotics, including VERSACLOZ.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include\r\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or\r\nblood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Associated findings can\r\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal\r\nfailure.\r\nThe diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. It is important to\r\nconsider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., severe neutropenia, infection,\r\nheat stroke, primary CNS pathology, central anticholinergic toxicity, extrapyramidal symptoms,\r\nand drug fever).\r\nThe management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs\r\nand other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and\r\nmedical monitoring, and (3) treatment of co-morbid medical conditions. There is no general\r\nagreement about specific pharmacological treatments for NMS.\r\nIf a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential\r\nreintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. NMS can recur. Monitor closely if\r\nrestarting treatment with antipsychotics.\r\nNMS has occurred with clozapine monotherapy and with concomitant CNS-active medications,\r\nincluding lithium.\r\n\r\n5.11 Fever\r\nDuring clozapine therapy, patients have experienced transient, clozapine-related fever. The peak\r\nincidence is within the first 3 weeks of treatment. While this fever is generally benign and selflimited, it may necessitate discontinuing treatment. The fever can be associated with an increase\r\nor decrease in WBC count. Carefully evaluate patients with fever to rule out severe neutropenia\r\nor infection. Consider the possibility of NMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].\r\n\r\n5.12 Pulmonary Embolism\r\nPulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have occurred in patients treated with clozapine.\r\nConsider the possibility of pulmonary embolism in patients who present with deep vein\r\nthrombosis, acute dyspnea, chest pain, or with other respiratory signs and symptoms. Whether\r\npulmonary embolus and deep vein thrombosis can be attributed to clozapine or some\r\ncharacteristic(s) of patients is not clear.\r\n\r\n5.13 Anticholinergic Toxicity\r\nVERSACLOZ has potent anticholinergic effects. Treatment with VERSACLOZ can result in\r\nCNS and peripheral anticholinergic toxicity. Use with caution in the presence of narrow-angle\r\nglaucoma, concomitant anticholinergic medications, prostatic hypertrophy, or other conditions in\r\nwhich anticholinergic effects can lead to significant adverse reactions.\r\nTreatment with VERSACLOZ can result in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including\r\nconstipation, intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, and paralytic ileus. Such reactions can be\r\nfatal. Constipation should be initially treated by ensuring adequate hydration and use of ancillary\r\ntherapy such as bulk laxatives. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is advisable in more\r\nserious cases.\r\n\r\n5.14 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance\r\nVERSACLOZ can cause sedation and impairment of cognitive and motor performance. Caution\r\npatients about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably\r\ncertain that VERSACLOZ does not affect them adversely. These reactions may be dose-related.\r\nConsider reducing the dose if they occur.\r\n\r\n5.15 Tardive Dyskinesia\r\nTardive dyskinesia (TD) has occurred in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including\r\nVERSACLOZ. The syndrome consists of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic\r\nmovements. The risk of TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to\r\nincrease with greater durations of treatment and higher total cumulative doses. However, the\r\nsyndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. Prescribe\r\nVERSACLOZ in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of developing TD. Use the\r\nlowest effective dose and the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. Periodically\r\nassess the need for continued treatment. Consider discontinuing treatment if TD occurs.\r\nHowever, some patients may require treatment with VERSACLOZ despite the presence of the\r\nsyndrome.\r\nThere is no known treatment for TD. However, the syndrome may remit partially or completely\r\nif treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, may suppress (or partially suppress)\r\nthe signs and symptoms, and it has the potential to mask the underlying process. The effect of\r\nsymptom suppression on the long-term course of TD is unknown.\r\n\r\n5.16 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions\r\nIn controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some atypical\r\nantipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions\r\n(e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased\r\nrisk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for VERSACLOZ or other\r\nantipsychotics or other patient populations. VERSACLOZ should be used with caution in\r\npatients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.\r\n\r\n5.17 Recurrence of Psychosis and Cholinergic Rebound after Abrupt Discontinuation of\r\nVERSACLOZ\r\nIf abrupt discontinuation of VERSACLOZ is necessary (because of severe neutropenia or\r\nanother medical condition, for example) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.1)], monitor carefully for the recurrence of psychotic symptoms and adverse\r\nreactions related to cholinergic rebound, such as profuse sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting,\r\nand diarrhea.

                            "Value": "7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect VERSACLOZ\r\nClozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4,\r\nand CYP2D6. Use caution when administering VERSACLOZ concomitantly with drugs that are\r\ninducers or inhibitors of these enzymes.\r\nCYP1A2 Inhibitors\r\nConcomitant use of VERSACLOZ and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of\r\nclozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the VERSACLOZ dose to one third\r\nof the original dose when VERSACLOZ is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g.,\r\nfluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The VERSACLOZ dose should be increased to the\r\noriginal dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued [see Dosage\r\nand Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\r\nModerate or weak CYP1A2 inhibitors include oral contraceptives and caffeine. Monitor patients\r\nclosely when VERSACLOZ is coadministered with these inhibitors. Consider reducing the\r\nVERSACLOZ dosage if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nCYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors\r\nConcomitant treatment with VERSACLOZ and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g.,\r\ncimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine,\r\nterbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions [see Clinical\r\nPharmacology (12.3)]. Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors.\r\nConsider reducing the VERSACLOZ dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nCYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers\r\nConcomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma\r\nconcentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of VERSACLOZ. Tobacco\r\nsmoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine,\r\nphenytoin, St. Johnâ€™s wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the VERSACLOZ dose\r\nif used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of\r\nVERSACLOZ and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and\r\nAdministration (2.7)].\r\nConsider reducing the VERSACLOZ dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme\r\ninducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and\r\nan increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].\r\nDrugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation\r\nUse caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit\r\nthe metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific\r\nantipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin,\r\nsparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III\r\nantiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate,\r\nmethadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see\r\nWarnings and Precautions (5.8)].\r\n\r\n7.2 Potential for VERSACLOZ to Affect Other Drugs\r\nConcomitant use of VERSACLOZ with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase levels\r\nof these CYP2D6 substrates. Use caution when coadministering VERSACLOZ with other drugs\r\nthat are metabolized by CYP2D6. It may be necessary to use lower doses of such drugs than\r\nusually prescribed. Such drugs include specific antidepressants, phenothiazines, carbamazepine,\r\nand Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and encainide). "

The studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due\r\nto clozapine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response,\r\nVERSACLOZ should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\r\nClinical Considerations\r\nConsider the risk of exacerbation of psychosis when discontinuing or changing treatment with\r\nantipsychotic medications during pregnancy and postpartum. Consider early screening for\r\ngestational diabetes for patients treated with antipsychotic medications [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.9)]. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of\r\npregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery.\r\nMonitor neonates for symptoms of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence,\r\nrespiratory distress, and feeding difficulties. The severity of complications can vary from selflimited symptoms to some neonates requiring intensive care unit support and prolonged\r\nhospitalization.\r\nAnimal Data\r\nIn embryofetal developmental studies, clozapine had no effects on maternal parameters, litter\r\nsizes, or fetal parameters when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period\r\nof organogenesis at doses up to 0.4 and 0.9 times, respectively, the MRHD of 900 mg/day on a\r\nmg/m2 body surface area basis. \r\nIn peri/postnatal developmental studies, pregnant female rats were administered clozapine over\r\nthe last third of pregnancy and until day 21 postpartum. Observations were made on fetuses at\r\nbirth and during the postnatal period; the offspring were allowed to reach sexual maturity and\r\nmated. Clozapine caused a decrease in maternal body weight but had no effects on litter size or\r\nbody weights of either F1 or F2 generations at doses up to 0.4 times the MRHD of 900 mg/day\r\non a mg/m2 body surface area basis.\r\n\r\n8.3 Nursing Mothers\r\nVERSACLOZ is present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in\r\nnursing infants from VERSACLOZ, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing\r\nor to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\r\n\r\n8.4 Pediatric Use\r\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\r\n\r\n8.5 Geriatric Use\r\nThere have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric patients in clinical studies utilizing\r\nVERSACLOZ to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in\r\ntheir response to VERSACLOZ.\r\nOrthostatic hypotension and tachycardia can occur with clozapine treatment [see Boxed Warning\r\nand Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Elderly patients, particularly those with compromised\r\ncardiovascular functioning, may be more susceptible to these effects.\r\nElderly patients may be particularly susceptible to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, such\r\nas urinary retention and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].\r\nCarefully select VERSACLOZ doses in elderly patients, taking into consideration their greater\r\nfrequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as other concomitant disease\r\nand other drug therapy. Clinical experience suggests that the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia\r\nappears to be highest among the elderly; especially elderly women [see Warnings and\r\nPrecautions (5.15)].\r\n\r\n8.6 Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment\r\nDose reduction may be necessary in patients with significant impairment of renal or hepatic\r\nfunction. Clozapine concentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is\r\nalmost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Clinical\r\nPharmacology (12.3)].\r\n\r\n8.7 CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers\r\nDose reduction may be necessary in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Clozapine\r\nconcentrations may be increased in these patients, because clozapine is almost completely metabolized and then excreted [see Dosage and Administration (2.8), Clinical Pharmacology\r\n(12.3)].\r\n\r\n8.8 Hospice Patients\r\nFor hospice patients (i.e., terminally ill patients with an estimated life expectancy of 6 months or\r\nless), the prescriber may reduce the ANC monitoring frequency to once every 6 months, after a\r\ndiscussion with the patient and his/her caregiver. Individual treatment decisions should weigh the\r\nimportance of monitoring ANC in the context of the need to control psychiatric symptoms and\r\nthe patientâ€™s terminal illness. "
